The Consumer Price Index (CPI) data revealed cooler-than-anticipated monthly and annual inflation rates for both headline and core items. 
This report arrives just ahead of the highly anticipated Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, which will commence at 2:00 p.m. ET today.
The implied probability of a rate cut by September has surged to 72%, up from 54% before the inflation report. Fed futures now indicate a 55 basis points reduction (equivalent to two rate cuts) by year-end.
In response to rising expectations for rate cuts, traders quickly pivoted to riskier assets.

The results came amid an exciting earnings season. Here are some key analyst takeaways.
Piper Sandler On Oracle
Analyst Brent Bracelin maintained an Overweight rating, while raising the price target from $140 to $150.
Oracle's reported quarterly revenue miss of $242 million ""takes a back seat to leading indicators like RPO metrics,"" given its backlog strength, especially the new contract signings of $32 billion in just six months, Bracelin said in a note.  
RPO growth accelerated from the previous quarter's 29% to 44% year-on-year to $98 billion, ""driven by robust new AI contract signings,"" the analyst stated, while adding that the company's cRPO growth remained at 15% for the second consecutive quarter. ""Non-GAAP operating margin improved q/q to 46.7% from 43.6%,"" he further wrote.
Stifel On Oracle
Analyst Brad Reback reiterated a Hold rating while lifting the price target from $120 to $135.
Oracle's results missed Street estimates ""across the board,"" Reback said. He added, however, that the stock rose in extended trading on RPO growth accelerated to 44% and management’s guidance of double-digit revenue growth for fiscal 2025.
With accelerating infrastructure demand, Oracle signed AI contracts of $12 billion, which is more than twice the prior $5 billion year to date, highlighted by OpenAI and xAI deals, and a partnership with Google-parent Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL).

Index futures are trading modestly higher in early pre-market trading. However, the sustainability of these gains and potential for further upside hinges largely on two key events: the upcoming inflation report due before the market opens and the Federal Reserve‘s June rate decision, along with commentary regarding the near-term interest rate trajectory. Investors will be hanging on to every word from Fed Chair Jerome Powell when he hosts the post-meeting press conference shortly after the rate decision.
Positive sentiment generated by Oracle Corp.’s (NYSE:ORCL) earnings may also provide support for tech stocks. While bond yields remained subdued, commodities prices firmed up.

The BigCommerce Holdings Thesis: There are few catalysts to drive BigCommerce’s shares in the medium term and the setup for the company’s revenue and profit upside for 2024 appearing “unattractive,” Ikeda said in the downgrade note.

Nvidia has unveiled four new discrete hardware offerings as part of its Blackwell launch, all based on its latest chip technology but differentiated by packaging and systems design. 
The lineup includes the B100, a direct replacement for the H100 architecture with a consistent TDP, available as an HGX offering. 
Also Read: Nvidia ‘1-2 Steps Ahead of Competitors’ After Blackwell GPU Reveal At GTC 2024, Analyst Says
The B200 features two dies linked via a 10 TB/s Nvidia High Bandwidth Interface, functioning as a single chip and available in an 8 GPU HGX variant. 
The GB200 combines two B200s (four dies) with a Grace processor, while the GB200 NVL72 is a liquid-cooled rack-scale system comprising 36 GB200 Superchips designed to act as a single GPU. These systems can be interconnected through Nvidia’s new X800 switches to form large clusters with minimal transport latency.
Bryson’s key takeaways include the B100 offering an easy upgrade path that could drive significant demand for Nvidia’s next-generation parts. He said the packaging and systems architectures of Nvidia’s new offerings promise substantial performance gains. 
The analyst noted that the B100 doubles training performance compared to the Hopper architecture due to Nvidia’s FP4 format. Bryson stated that the B200 quadruples training performance is further enhanced when packaged with Nvidia’s Grace processor in the GB200 and GB200 NVL72 systems.

The event will likely set off a tidal wave of spending in the tech sector, with a forecast of over $1 trillion in AI investments over the next decade, he said.

AI Frenzy
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ: QQQ).
Note the following:

QQQ is above the trendline shown on the chart.
The chart shows that QQQ ran up in spite of hotter inflation data. Yesterday, gamma squeeze and AI frenzy completely overpowered inflation data that was negative for the stock market.
Prudent investors know the market cannot ignore inflation forever. While the stock market and the economy are not the same thing, they can not be completely divorced from one another.
As long as QQQ stays above the trendline shown on the chart, the rapidly increasing YOLO (you only live once) behavior in the stock market will continue. In YOLO behavior, investors give up any notion of risk.
The chart shows that if QQQ starts pulling back, the major support zone is far off.
Oracle Corp (NYSE: ORCL) earnings indicated there is a strong demand for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA) chips.
NVDA stock ran up on Oracle earnings, which pulled up other AI stocks and led the market higher.
Quadruple witching is this Friday. Quadruple witching is to the upside.
The incessant call buying by the momo crowd is leading to a gamma squeeze, putting upward pressure on the stock market. Gamma squeeze is an important market mechanic. Understanding gamma squeeze can give investors an edge.
NVDA has now totally replaced Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) as the momo crowd’s favorite stock. The momo crowd is selling TSLA and buying NVDA.
The next major trigger for the stock market will be the Nvidia GTC event that starts on March 18.
The momo crowd is caught up in the AI frenzy to such a large extent that the momo crowd has decided inflation does not matter anymore.

The company added that it was opening new and expanding existing cloud datacenters “very rapidly.”

Lower-than-expected inflation could fuel hopes of the Fed implementing rate cuts this year, driving the current market rally. Conversely, a higher-than-expected figure could trigger a sell-off. Oracle Corp.’s (NYSE:ORCL) positive earnings reaction could boost the tech sector.
Cues From Previous Session:
Monday’s session reflected nervousness about the upcoming inflation report and its impact on monetary policy. Major indices entered the session after experiencing losses for the week ending March 8th. Opening lower and falling further initially, the indices pared their losses throughout the day but closed mixed. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and broader S&P 500 closed lower, while the Dow Industrials managed a slight gain. Small-cap stocks underperformed larger counterparts, surrendering some recent gains.
Fund manager Louis Navellier said the market caution was due in part to the CPI and PPI data coming, “which may confirm that marching from 3% inflation to the Fed’s 2% target is likely to be challenging.”
Real estate, industrials, IT, consumer discretionary, communication services, and healthcare sectors closed in the red. Energy, materials, utilities, financials, and consumer staples gained ground.

Investors are likely focusing on key economic data releases, particularly the February Consumer Price Index (CPI) report due Tuesday. This data is seen as crucial for the Federal Reserve’s upcoming interest rate decision on March 19-20.

The strong February non-farm payrolls report triggered profit-taking in overvalued tech stocks, despite the S&P 500 reaching a record high on Thursday and the broader market experiencing intraday highs on Friday. This early euphoria faded, leading to a pullback and negative close on Friday.

Higher interest rates are blamed for the challenges companies are facing, and the Fed’s signal that it is ready to begin cutting rates in the first half of 2024 could boost traders’ risk appetite.
Corporate updates for the day have largely been negative, potentially triggering a sell-off in the respective sectors.
Cues From Monday's Trading:
The resilient market weathered a bout of profit-taking and ended Monday’s session higher. The gains reflected investors’ optimism about positive outcomes for key economic catalysts due later in the week. The major averages opened on a mixed note and moved lacklusterly in the morning session. They decisively rose in the afternoon, closing higher for the day.
The averages rose for a third straight session, with the Dow Industrials ending at nearly a two-year high, and the S&P 500 Index and the Nasdaq Composite at their highest levels since March 2022 and early February 2022, respectively.

The prevailing sentiment is cautious, with attention turning to Treasury auctions, particularly the 10-year notes, and the market’s response to them, which could heavily impact trader sentiment. Until these key catalysts play out, the market may experience limited momentum.
Recap Of Last Week’s Trading:
In the week ending Dec. 8, stocks sustained upward momentum, although buying interest waned. The three major averages, along with the Russell 2000 Index featuring small-cap stocks, closed in positive territory.
Reflecting on the economic developments of the past week, Brad McMillan, Chief Investment Officer at Commonwealth Financial Network, expressed positivity. He highlighted that the November jobs report revealed job additions surpassing expectations for the month, even though the pace of job growth has significantly slowed from the robust levels observed earlier this year. Additionally, the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment reading exceeded expectations, indicating positive prospects for holiday sales.
“The U.S. economy continues to chug along and is still headed for a soft landing. Interest rates have largely normalized, and markets are following suit,” he said.

Arm's architecture is the foundation of smartphones. The analyst sees the world as entering a post-smartphone era that will see high-performance computing and IoT lead the next phase of semiconductor growth. 
Shi attributed Arm's past success in smartphones to its tightly controlled ecosystem. In new growth areas, however, viable alternatives to Arm exist, and ecosystem control often resides in the hands of others. 
Arm can grow by capturing more excellent value from smartphones, but not enough to support the upside from the stock's IPO valuation. So, the analyst awaits a better entry point.

Oracle reported revenue of $12.45 billion, up 9% year-over-year, and first-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.19, beating a Street consensus estimate of $1.15.
The 9% and 16% growth rates in revenue and non-GAAP EPS during 1Q indeed suggest that the decade of 1% growth is now behind ORCL. That said, the 2Q growth outlook was lower at 3% to 5% (vs. 8% this quarter), even with healthy underlying growth for Oracle Cloud, which grew by 29% Y/Y (vs. 33% Y/Y last quarter). 
While headwinds to the non-cloud and Cerner segment have surfaced, he remains confident that a mix shift to cloud that has increased to 32% of sales (vs. 22% three years ago) could help reaccelerate the growth trajectory over the next 3-5 years. The AI backlog for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) has doubled Q/Q to $4 billion, with RPO increasing by 7% Y/Y to $65 billion. The analyst expects 2Q revenue of $12.99 billion and EPS of $1.33.

Auto Worker Strike Likely
Please click here for a chart of General Motors Co (NYSE: GM).
Note the following:

The Morning Capsule is about the big picture, not an individual stock. The chart of GM stock is being used to illustrate the point.
The chart shows that GM stock has given up all of its summer rally gains. The reason is a potential strike by United Auto Workers (UAW).
President Biden claims to be the most pro-union president. President Biden has been predicting that UAW will not strike.
In The Arora Report analysis, the probability of a UAW strike is very high.
UAW President Shawn Fain is talking about the possibility of a simultaneous strike against GM, Ford Motor Co (NYSE: F), and Stellantis NV (NYSE: STLA).
In The Arora Report analysis, if there is a simultaneous strike against all three automakers, it will put Michigan in a recession and will have a major negative impact on the U.S. economy.  
The union is especially upset that new plants such as those for batteries are not unionized.
UAW is blaming the Biden administration for giving away billions of dollars of subsidies without demanding wage standards.
All of the foregoing is positive for Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) as Tesla is not unionized.
On August 29, we shared with you:

Today, Tesla (TSLA) is turning on a massive NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA) cluster consisting of 10,000 H100 GPUs. The cluster will be used to train FSD (Full Self-Driving). Tesla is also spending $1B to build its own Dojo supercomputer.


There is heavy buying in TSLA stock in the early trade as a Wall Street bank highlights Dojo and states that Dojo can add up to $500B in value to Tesla.
The momo crowd’s pattern is to buy ahead of events, ignoring the risk. The reason is that the momo crowd believes that every event that is ahead is going to run up the stock market. In the early trade, the momo crowd is aggressively buying stocks ahead of several events.

CPI will be released on September 13 at 8:30am ET, followed by PPI on September 14 at 8:30am ET.

The US government spent more than it earned in May…by a lot.


Revenues fell 21% YoY to $307 billion while outlays–led by Medicare spending–rose 20% to $548 billion.


The resulting $240 billion budget deficit for the month was more than double the deficit in May 2022.


For the fiscal year, the gap has widened to $1.16 trillion, a 191% jump from a year ago.



This year has already seen more debt defaults in the US junk loan market (in number and total value) than all of 2021 and 2022…combined.


A rapid rise in interest rates over the past year has left junk-rated companies–many of which had loaded up on leveraged loans at floating rates–facing higher interest payments as slowing economic growth caps earnings.


Last month alone saw $7.8 billion in defaults, the highest since the pandemic.


Looking ahead, more defaults are expected as the Fed keeps interest rates higher for longer.



Consumers are becoming more optimistic about inflation.


The NY Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations for May revealed short-term (1-year ahead) inflation expectations dropped to the lowest since May 2021 at 4.1%.


Medium- (3-year) and long-term (5-year) expectations, on the other hand, ticked up by 0.1% each to 3% and 2.7%, respectively.


The survey also showed consumers are less optimistic about wages with one-year expected earnings falling to 2.8% from 3%.


Meanwhile, their expected odds of being laid off dropped by 1.3% to the lowest since April 2022.

Shares of Tesla advanced for the 12th straight day yesterday, marking the stock’s longest daily winning streak ever.

Fed future swaps indicate investors currently assign an 88% probability of the Fed holding interest rates steady at 5-5.25% in June, as opposed to a 12% chance of a further 0.25% hike.

After holding barely above the unchanged line until early afternoon trading, the averages lost ground and steadily declined through the remainder of the session.
The S&P 500 Index settled at its lowest since Jan. 19 and also dropped below its 200-day moving average, a key support level. The Dow Industrials plunged to a four-month low.

Traders may wait and watch Friday's job data before plotting their next moves.
Cues From Wednesday’s Trading: 
On Wednesday, the major indices went about in a listless manner as traders digested Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s  remarks before the Financial Services Committee and the stronger-than-expected ADP private payrolls data. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 indices flitted in and out of the unchanged line before a late-hour buying spree helped them settle higher for the day.

The Dow Industrials languished mostly below the unchanged line before closing lower.
The sentiment was mixed across sectors, with technology, utility, real estate and material stocks moving notably to the downside, while energy stocks came under intense selling pressure. Healthcare and consumer discretionary stocks also showed some weakness.

The deal marked the largest deal in league history with the NBA team and WNBA’s Phoenix Mercury valued at $4 billion.
Here’s a look at the sale and the potential new NBA rivalry it could be creating.
What Happened: The Suns will now be majority-owned by Mat Ishbia and his brother Justin Ishbia with them acquiring more than 50% ownership of the team from current owner Robert Sarver. Mat Ishbia is the CEO and chairman of UWM Holdings Corp (NYSE: UWMC), a mortgage company that went public in January 2021.
The $4 billion valuation of the Suns marked the largest in NBA history, surpassing the $4.4 billion valuation of the Brooklyn Nets in 2019.
“Mat is the right leader to build on franchise legacies of winning and community support and shepherd the Suns and Mercury into the next era,” Sarver said. “As a former collegiate basketball player and national champion, Mat has exactly the right spirit, commitment and resources to pursue championships.”
The acquisition was pending league approval and had no completion date. While the Ishbias will own a majority stake, other owners will also stay on, which could include Dyal Capital Partners, a unit of Blue Owl Capital Inc (NYSE: OWL), which acquired a minority stake in 2021.
Ishbia called it a dream come true and shared more about his basketball and mortgage experience.

Hosted by the two Manning brothers, Manningcast offers more laid-back commentary and viewing of the game along with interviews with guests during the game.

Two of the five new deals announced were potential deals in the works.
TEGNA Inc. (NYSE: TGNA)
Founded in 1906 and headquartered in Tysons, Virginia, TEGNA is a digital media and marketing services company. It was created on June 29, 2015, when the Gannett Company split into two publicly traded companies.
We first added TEGNA as a potential deal in the works on August 16, 2019, when Apollo Global Management (NYSE: APO) approached the company about a deal. TEGNA’s price after this announcement was $14.28. On January 21, 2020, another large investor in Tegna (NYSE: TGNA) wanted the company to pursue a merger or sale. During March 2020 even as the nation was coming to grips with a new pandemic and the market dropped sharply, Tegna received four competing offers.
Bidding War Timeline

On March 6, 2020, Gray Television (NYSE: GTN) made an offer to acquire Tegna (NYSE: TGNA) for approximately $8.5 billion in a cash plus stock deal worth $20 per share.
Media mogul Byron Allen made a bid for the company on March 11, 2020.
A week later, on March 17, 2020, the Najafi Companies announced the delivery of an offer to Tegna’s (TGNA) board of directors to jointly acquire the company. Gray Television withdrew its offer the same day.
The following day on March 30, 2020, shares of Tegna (NYSE: TGNA) fell the most since November 2008, Apollo Global Management ended its pursuit of the broadcaster, the second suitor to withdraw an offer during the ongoing turmoil in global markets. TGNA’s closing price on March 30 was $10.31.
On September 21, 2021, Tegna once again received takeover interest from media mogul Byron Allen and Apollo Global Management. TGNA’s price after this announcement was $21.52.
On November 5, 2021, Byron Allen raised $10 billion in preferred equity and debt for his bid for Tegna, hoping to prevail over a rival offer from investment firms Apollo Global Management and Standard General.
On February 4, 2022, Tegna announced that it was in advanced discussions with one of its largest shareholders, Standard General, about a potential buyout at about $24 a share.
On February 21, 2022, Bloomberg reported that Standard General and Apollo Global Management were nearing a deal to acquire Tegna. TGNA’s price before this announcement was $20.95.
The deal was confirmed the next day on February 24, 2022, with Tegna agreeing to be acquired by an affiliate of Standard General for $24.00 per share in cash. The transaction has an enterprise value of approximately $8.6 billion, representing a premium of approximately 39% to TEGNA’s unaffected closing share price on September 14, 2021, the last full trading day prior to media speculation about a potential sale of TEGNA. TEGNA shareholders could also receive additional cash consideration in the form of an unusual “ticking fee”. The details of the “ticking fee” are given in the New Deals section below.

This was one of the “Deals In The Works” that appeared to have a high probability of closing given the level of interest from multiple parties, the specificity of the details that leaked and the fact that the company also confirmed that it was in advanced discussions.

Wall Street Crime and Punishment is a weekly series by Benzinga's Phil Hall chronicling the bankers, brokers and financial ne’er-do-wells whose ambition and greed take them in the wrong direction. 
When the media charted Elizabeth Holmes’ ascension to corporate power, the one consistency in the coverage was the obsession with her appearance: her long blonde hair, her penchant for wearing Steve Jobs-style black turtlenecks and her baritone voice that many observers believed was out of sync with her demure femininity.
Even a veteran writer like the New Yorker’s Ken Auletta got caught in the style trap in his December 2014 profile of Holmes, with Holmes flaunting her intellect by declaring how she read “Moby-Dick” at age nine and how she was fluent in Mandarin. Auletta peppered his coverage with comments on how her voice dropped an octave during on-stage presentations and how she “pinned her hair into an unruly bun.”
Perhaps one could excuse the heavy-handed obsession with feminine style to the fact that Holmes did not fit the stereotypical image of the Silicon Valley go-getter as a lumpy dude in a well-worn hoodie. As a young female professional in an industry dominated by middle-aged men, she certainly stood out from the crowd.
And perhaps this made Holmes’ downfall all the more jolting. Many people viewed her as the force of energy who could break barriers in bringing a new generation of women into high-tech leadership, and the acknowledgment of her failings offered a bitter affirmation that middle-aged men were the only ones to face accusations of financial fraud.

A Prodigy Emerges: Elizabeth Anne Holmes was born Feb. 3, 1984, in Washington, D.C. Her father, Christian Holmes IV, was an Enron executive who found work in federal agencies after his company’s downfall and her mother, Noel Anne Daoust, worked on Capitol Hill as an aide for the foreign policy and defense committees. Holmes’ great-great-grandfather was a Danish immigrant who settled in Cincinnati, became a prominent surgeon and married the heiress of the Fleischmann yeast empire, thus creating a lineage of wealth and privilege.
“I grew up with those stories about greatness,” Holmes would recall in the December 2014 New Yorker profile. “And about people deciding not to spend their lives on something purposeful, and what happens to them when they make that choice — the impact on character and quality of life.”
When she was nine, Holmes’ father relocated the family to Houston, where he took the job of CEO at the energy and manufacturing conglomerate Tenneco Inc (NYSE: TEN). She would later claim that her father felt guilty about relocating the family to Texas, so she wrote him a letter stating, “What I really want out of life is to discover something new, something that mankind didn’t know was possible to do.”
Shortly after arriving in Houston, Holmes’ parents arranged for her to receive tutoring in Mandarin. Her father made numerous business trips to China before Holmes was born and recognized the country’s potential to become a global economic force. By the time she was a high school sophomore, Holmes managed to secure summer class placement in Mandarin studies at Stanford University, and in 2002 she enrolled at Stanford after completing her high school studies.
Holmes originally considered pursuing a career in chemical engineering, and at the end of her freshman year, she landed a summer position at the Genome Institute of Singapore where she conducted tests for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which had broken out in China.
Holmes theorized that the traditional testing manner of collecting blood samples with syringes could be improved upon, and by 2003 she filed a patent application for a wearable medical device designed to “analyte monitoring and drug delivery."" The patent was approved in 2007 but the device was never manufactured.
Holmes believed that she could go further as a self-starting entrepreneur rather than ...","News,Health Care,Small Cap,Top Stories,General"

In light of this occasion, Benzinga spoke with Immutable’s chairman and CEO Jordan Fried about his efforts to improve access to blockchain equity.
Finding Crypto: Fried’s foray into digital assets and blockchain started out with building online secondary markets for video game currencies.
It wasn’t until years later while running a virtual private network (VPN) startup — Buffered VPN —  Fried found and accepted Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) for payment.
“I had become an ex-pat living in Budapest, Hungary, and the internet sucked,” he said. “There were a lot of websites that were blocked because of censorship. If the Wall Street Journal wrote an article that was very critical of the Hungarian government, the article would be blocked.”
Later, whistleblower Edward Snowden proclaimed that the U.S. government was spying on people at scale. Overnight, that development increased the VPN business 100-times over.
Fried sold the company and made it out with the bitcoin.
Building Crypto: After Buffered, Fried recalls not being at peace.
“I did everything I wanted to do in life. I saw everything. That whole time, though, I could not figure out why I was not happy,” he explained. “I learned I didn’t really need the money. The money was the fortunate byproduct of building something.”

However, the Energy sector is in focus Friday morning as Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX) announce better-than-expected earnings and revenue. Exxon reported a 30% increase in average daily production of oil barrels from ...","News,Earnings,Futures,Commodities,Retail Sales,Global,Economics,Federal Reserve,Markets,Tech,Media,General"

During that fast-paced, highly informative hour, traders and investors tune in to get the major news of the day, the catalysts behind those moves and the corresponding price action for the upcoming session.
On any given day, the show will cover at least 20 stocks determined by co-hosts Joel Elconin and Dennis Dick along with producer Spencer Israel.
Over the many years of observing stocks following earnings reports, there are certain trends that seem to persist over time. Nothing is 100% reliable, but these seem to occur more times than not.
One of those observations is that Oracle Corp (NYSE: ORCL) will retreat following its earning reports, and then, more often than not, will regain its footing and rally back. With that concept in mind, it is the PreMarket Prep Stock of the Day.
One Example: At least some investors were employing this concept heading into Oracle’s fourth-quarter report back in June. Six days prior to its report (June 8), the issue made a new all-time high at $85.02 and posted its all-time closing high that same day at $84.61.

Year-over-year CPI growth came in at 5.3%, just below analysts’ consensus of 5.4%, so that was something the bulls might be able to hang their hat on. And the monthly growth of 0.3% was just short of the 0.4% Wall Street consensus collected ahead of the report by research firm Briefing.com.
It’s arguably the first glimmer in a while of inflation may be beginning to cool off slightly after months of huge gains as the economy came out of the Covid lockdown period and supply chains got pressured. There’s still all kinds of supply chain hold-ups, with the media reporting about ships backed up at ports and rail cars being hard to find. Today’s CPI report showing a slight miss in the inflation numbers doesn’t change any of that, because one report isn’t a trend.
The Fed is likely giving today’s data and last Friday’s producer price index (PPI) a pretty close look as it decides whether it needs to step in and begin ramping down its bond purchase program. A number like today’s, even if it’s lower than expected, indicates that inflation remains a major issue.
Despite Bump From CPI News, Market Remains In “No Man’s Land”
Still, stock index futures appeared to get a nice bump immediately after the data flash. That contrasts with the way stocks came down to finish well off their highs on Monday. A weak close like that sometimes can roll into trading the following session, so keep an eye out for any sort of follow-through to the downside early on.
Also, one day of recovery after a long stretch of weakness doesn’t necessarily mean we’re out of the woods. We’re going into this strange period, where you kind of have a lack of numbers, without many key data after CPI and retail sales this week. Earnings are kind of a desert, too. In this “no man’s land,” the market is looking for anything to trade-off.
One thing to consider watching comes later today when Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is scheduled to hold an event starting early this afternoon East Coast time. Media reports suggest the event could include the launch of the iPhone 13 and a new Apple Watch. Stay tuned. And remember that in the past, these events haven’t typically lit a huge fire under AAPL shares, but there’s always a first time for everything, as the saying goes.
Yesterday was kind of a “yo-yo” day for the market, in part because people didn’t have a lot of fresh data or earnings to trade on. It could be a “yo-yo” day again today because we’re in this odd period. Meanwhile, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) is flirting with 20 again, crude is above $70 a barrel, the 10-year yield is trying to get back to 1.35% and the 30-year yield is trying to get back to 2%.

It’s living up to that so far as last week was the worst in three months, but some green shoots pushed through the sidewalk cracks this morning as eyes turn to the Tech sector after a ragged Friday. 
Stocks enter the week on a five-day skid as investors assess historically high valuations and the possibility of a more hawkish Fed. Another factor has been rising caseloads of Covid’s Delta variant, something that has many analysts rethinking their calculations for U.S. economic growth. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL), two of the biggest companies by market capitalization, had a hiccup Friday on bad news (see more below), adding to the weight. 
Over the last few days, however, the average daily number of cases has started falling, according to government data. That appears to have raised a bit of hope in overnight trading as major indices popped back up following some early directionless action. The pre-market rebound was accompanied by a fall in volatility after it roared to three-week highs at the end of last week. 
It’s a nice recovery this morning, but we saw this movie a couple of times last week where things started off hot and then quickly got cold. The question is whether the market can pick up any follow-through buying after the first half-hour or so. 
September Earning Its Bad Reputation So Far
Checking back over the last week of performance, it’s just a sea of red. Only one of the 11 S&P 500 sectors rose in the last five sessions, and that was Consumer Discretionary—up a tiny 0.22%. The big cyclical sectors like Financials, Industrials, and Materials had the worst performances, while the overall S&P 500 Index (SPX) fell nearly 1%. 
Friday’s stumble threw a wet blanket on things heading into the weekend as selling picked up toward the close. A few negative notes about the overall market from major investment banks might have been a factor.
One school of thought is that we haven’t had a major sell-off in a long time, raising concerns that the market might be due for one. The counter-argument is that despite the recent weakness, a lot of analysts continue to say U.S. stocks are one of the better games in town compared to other potential investments. With inflation as high as it is now, investments in fixed income, for instance, would lose value at current yields. 
All this selling evidently has investors worried, as the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) stormed to big gains in the late hours of Friday’s session to finish above 20 for the first time in almost a month. VIX hasn’t been able to maintain gains above 20 for very long recently (see chart), but a few days above 20 might indicate investors are truly concerned about more turbulence ahead. 
On Friday, it certainly didn’t help that most of the so-called “mega-cap” stocks like AAPL, GOOGL, and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) lost ground as the old week expired. Stocks like these have so much weight in the SPX that when they sneeze, the market often catches a cold. 
Soft Spot On The Apple
With AAPL, the sneeze appeared to reflect investor disappointment over a U.S. federal judge’s ruling that, according to The New York Times, “struck a serious blow to Apple’s control of its App Store, giving companies a way to avoid handing Apple a cut of their app sales and potentially upending a $100 billion ...","News,Earnings,Government,Regulations,Commodities,Retail Sales,Legal,Global,Economics,Federal Reserve,Markets,Tech,General"

The Delta variant seems to be sinking its teeth into the economy, taking a massive bite into the jobs picture. 
Job gains of 235,000 in August reported today by the U.S. government were more than 500,000 below the average analyst estimate for 750,000, and raise new questions about the pace of economic growth as the country continues to struggle with Covid. Lack of any gains for the Leisure and Hospitality sector played a big role in the disappointing data. 
On the plus side, the Labor Department did raise its estimates for jobs growth in June and July, to 962,000 and 1.1 million, respectively. You can’t necessarily discount the possibility that we could see an upward revision for August next month but, given the impact Leisure & Hospitality had on today’s report (see more below), subsequent reports could hinge on the Delta variant. 
Major indices held pretty steadily after the report—arguably quite a feat given the recent string of record highs. Perhaps it’s one of those times when bad news doesn’t have much of an impact on stock prices, as a report like this could ease fears of any near-term Fed move to pull back on stimulus. Remember, just a week ago Fed Chairman Jerome Powell suggested the Fed could begin tapering its bond-buying program but added that employment hadn’t met the central bank’s goals. This report doesn’t really go very far to meet the Fed’s goal of getting employment back to where it was before Covid.
A Peek Under The Hood Of Today’s Report
Having said all that, remember, this is just one month of data. One month or one report is never a trend. Jobs growth is averaging a healthy 766,000 a month since June, even with today’s disappointing number factored in.
Also, a lot of this miss appeared to be centered in the Leisure and Hospitality space, where employment was unchanged after averaging gains of 350,000 per month over the previous six months. That’s probably the biggest reason for the huge miss in expectations by Wall Street, and likely reflects Delta variant concerns affecting restaurants and hotels. Assuming the country gets a handle on this variant in the coming months, it’s possible jobs growth in this category could rebound pretty quickly, as it often has following disturbances.
It was good to see 37,000 jobs added in manufacturing and 53,000 jobs added in transportation and warehousing during August. Those are categories you like to see going up because they can speak to decent underlying growth in economic demand by businesses and consumers. Also, average hourly earnings rose 0.6%, which was above the 0.3% estimate and might have partly reflected a lack of growth in the low-paying Leisure and Hospitality sector. This isn’t a number that’s likely to have the Fed worried about wage inflation, but it does mean more money going into peoples’ pockets—never a bad thing. 
Also, you can’t overlook that the overall unemployment rate fell to 5.2% from 5.4% the previous month. That’s the lowest since Covid began. Sometimes, drops in the unemployment rate can reflect discouraged workers leaving the labor force and no longer being counted as unemployed, but that wasn’t the case in August. Among those not in the labor force who wanted a job, or, as the Labor Department defines it, “the number of persons marginally attached to the labor force,” decreased by 295,000 over the month.
Before the jobs report today, the market seemed tied up in a dull, pre-holiday type of trading over the last few sessions. Outside of the data, we don’t really have anything that you can hang your hat on and say this is where we’re going, or that this ...","News,Earnings,Guidance,Commodities,Retail Sales,Small Cap,Global,Economics,Federal Reserve,Markets,Tech,General"
