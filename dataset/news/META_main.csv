What Happened: Struggling video game retailer GameStop became the target of short sellers betting on a further decline or bankruptcy. Community support on the r/Wallstreetbets subreddit and other social media outlets led to an epic short squeeze story that dominated the headlines in early 2021 and throughout the year.
One of the places where the short squeeze story gained steam was on Benzinga’s “Power Hour” show, where Citron Research’s Andrew Left joined to share his thesis on why he was betting against GameStop.
On Jan. 21, Left was interviewed live and the video had thousands of messages in the chat defending GameStop’s future growth and why Left was wrong.
The stock rose on the day and over the next several days, leading the Benzinga interview to be one of the places considered as the “room where it happened.”
Two other central figures in the GameStop storyline were Ryan Cohen and Keith Patrick Gill. 
Cohen is the founder of Chewy Inc (NYSE: CHWY) and is now the chairman of the video game retailer. Cohen took a 9% stake in GameStop which was announced in August 2020 and increased his stake to 13% in 2021, becoming a hero figure for those rallying around GameStop.
Keith Patrick Gill, who went by the handle Roaring Kitty on YouTube and DeepF***ingValue on Reddit, placed a $56,000 bet on GameStop through call options and posted his research to YouTube and Reddit. Gill’s investment was worth tens of millions of dollars in January 2021.
Retail traders were drawn to GameStop thanks to research online and also as a way to take on hedge funds ...","News,Penny Stocks,Gaming,Small Cap,Top Stories,General"

Kostin stated in a note released Monday.
Election Impact on Markets
Investors are closely watching Thursday’s first presidential debate, which is expected to influence betting-based predictions of the election outcomes. According to betting website Polymarket, there is a 57.5% likelihood of a Trump win and a 34.5% chance of a Biden win (FiveThirtyEight currently shows a dead heat between the two candidates).
Additionally, there is a 73% chance of Republicans winning the Senate and a 54% chance of Democrats retaining control of the House. The probability of a Republican sweep stands at 42%, nearly double the 22% odds of a Democratic sweep.
Historical Performance Trends
Goldman Sachs highlighted historical trends where U.S. stocks with a focus on domestic sales outperformed those with greater international exposure by 1 percentage point (pp) the day after Trump’s election and by 4 pp in the following month. However, these domestically-focused stocks underperformed by 9 pp during the 12 months after the election.

This disparity has prompted notable Wall Street veteran investor Ed Yardeni to comment that “the stock market has a bad breadth problem again.”
In a note sent to Yardeni Research’s subscribers on Sunday, the expert explained that while the past saw this issue due to the outperformance of the Magnificent 7 stocks, recently, it appears to be narrowing to the “Magnificent One,” namely Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA).

The iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF (NYSE:IWF) has surged by 6.5% so far in June 2024. This gain puts it on track for its seventh month of increases in the last eight.
Investors have shown elevated confidence in growth-oriented sectors, particularly technology, which continues to benefit from strong earnings reports, heightened expectations for future cash flows and positive market sentiment, especially towards AI-related industries.
In stark contrast, the iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (NYSE:IWD), representing the other major equity style, has declined by 1.4% in June. 
This divergence highlights the challenges facing value stocks, which typically encompass sectors like financials, energy, utilities, and consumer staples. These sectors have struggled to attract investor interest due to their less impressive performance and subdued earnings expectations.
The performance gap between growth and value in June 2024 stands at a striking 7.9 percentage points, marking the most substantial monthly performance difference since May 2023. ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","Sector ETFs,Analyst Color,Equities,Large Cap,Mid Cap,Broad U.S. Equity ETFs,Small Cap,Top Stories,Markets,Analyst Ratings,Tech,ETFs"

Lower PPI
Please click here for an enlarged chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows that the stock market took another leg up on Consumer Price Index (CPI) data yesterday. Please click here for details.
The chart shows that after the Fed announcement, the stock market pulled back as the dot plot was more hawkish than expected. Please see click here for details.
The chart shows that the stock market first jumped this morning on release of Producer Price Index (PPI) and jobless claims data.
RSI on the chart shows that the stock market is very overbought. Overbought markets tend to be susceptible to a pullback.
The chart shows that the volume was higher yesterday than other recent low volume days, but the volume was not high enough considering the strong rally. This is a negative.
Inflation at the producer level came cooler than expected. Here are the details:

Headline PPI came at -0.2% vs. 0.1% consensus.
Core PPI came at 0.0% vs. 0.3% consensus.


In The Arora Report analysis, a big part of the drop in PPI is because of the following reasons:

We have been sharing with readers that producer prices in China have been dropping. Since the U.S. imports a large amount of goods from China, China is exporting disflation to the U.S.
Oil prices have fallen due to concerns about a weak economy. Oil contributes significantly to PPI.


Weekly initial claims came at 242K vs. 224K consensus. This indicates that the jobs picture is weakening.  Initial jobless claims is a leading indicator and carries heavy weight in our adaptive ZYX Asset Allocation Model with inputs in ten categories.  In plain English, adaptiveness means that the model changes itself with market conditions. Please click here to see how this is achieved.
The sentiment is extremely positive in addition to CPI, PPI, and jobless claims.  The following are adding to the positive sentiment.

Elon Musk is claiming that shareholders voted for his pay package. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock is jumping about 7% as of this writing in the premarket.

Cooler CPI
Please click here for an enlarged chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows the stock market taking another leg up on cooler Consumer Price Index (CPI).
The chart shows the volume has been low, indicating lack of conviction. In theory, the volume today should be significantly higher. The Arora Report will be carefully watching the volume.
RSI on the chart shows the market is overbought, making it susceptible to a pullback.
CPI data came cooler than expected. Here are the details:

Headline CPI came at 0.0% vs. 0.1% consensus. This is the lowest since 2020.
Core CPI came at 0.2% vs. 0.3% consensus.


In The Arora Report analysis, the probability of a rate cut in September is now 55%, and the probability of a rate cut in December is 90%.    
The Fed’s rate decision will be announced at 2pm ET, followed by Powell’s press conference at 2:30pm ET.
At The Arora Report, we will be carefully watching the dot plot. The dot plot indicates interest rate projections of FOMC members.

China
Inflation in China is also falling both at the producer level and the consumer level. Since the U.S. is a major importer of Chinese goods, lower producer level inflation in China also helps lower inflation in the U.S. Here are the details:

China’s CPI came at 0.1% month-over-month vs. 0.0% consensus and 0.3% year-over-year vs. 0.4% consensus.

A new report from investor Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest outlines future AI disruptions and its capacity to shape the markets.
The Shift to AI: The report said consumers’ adoption of AI will be much faster than their adoption of previous technologies, such as the smartphone and the personal computer.
“Our research suggests that AI-enabled consumer hardware — defined as hardware with integrated AI agents — could penetrate 50% of the U.S. internet user base in fewer than four years, and nearly 75% penetration by the end of 2030, up from near-zero in 2022,” the report said.
The report saw AI as a significant time saver for consumers, who can heed AI product recommendations instead of doing the research themselves. 
ARK Invest cited a study that showed consumers spend on average 15 hours researching cars before making a purchase, time which could be saved dramatically by AI. Its research suggested that AI could facilitate $9 trillion in global private consumption by 2030.
“While brand recognition and loyalty currently play meaningful roles in consumer purchases, especially of non-discretionary goods and services, brand leverage is likely to shift from consumer-facing applications and marketplaces to trusted AI agents,” the ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","Analyst Color,Tech,ETFs"

Strong Jobs Report
Please click here for an enlarged chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

Cross currents in the stock market are increasing. Investors may need to handle increasing volatility due to cross currents. The best way to handle increasing volatility is to follow the protection band.
Hedges are being raised. 
The chart shows that after hitting the low band of the support zone, the stock market made a new high. This is technically a bullish pattern.
The chart shows yesterday was the lowest volume day in a long time. This indicates a lack of conviction. RSI on the chart shows that the stock market can go either way.
The chart shows that the stock market is selling off in the early trade on a stronger than expected jobs report.
Here are the details of the jobs report:

Nonfarm payrolls came at 272K vs. 186K consensus.
Nonfarm private payrolls came at 229K vs. 168K consensus.
Average hourly earnings came at 0.4% vs. 0.3% consensus.
Average work week came at 34.3 hours vs. 34.3 hours consensus.
Unemployment rate came at 4.0% vs. 3.9% consensus.


In The Arora Report analysis, the jobs report, when taken in totality along with the recent weak data from JOLTS and jobless claims, precludes the Fed from cutting rates at this time if the Fed is truly data dependent.  
Momo gurus have been persuading their followers to buy stocks ahead of the jobs report because they claimed they knew the jobs report would be very weak.  Momo gurus are wrong again.  However, momo gurus have some ammunition for a new narrative to persuade their followers to continue to buy stocks. In The Arora Report analysis, here is the ammunition momo gurus can use:

The unemployment rate rose.
Household survey data was weaker.
Much of the job creation was in government and service industries such as hospitality.


Smart money is trimming stocks on the strong jobs report. Keep in mind that smart money owns very large stock positions. They just trim into the strength. In contrast, many in the ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","Economics,Markets,General"

Buying On Bad News
Please click here for an enlarged chart of iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ: TLT).
Note the following:

The chart shows that bonds have rapidly moved up after consolidating in the mini support zone.
The chart shows that bonds are now in the resistance zone.
Higher bonds mean lower yields.  For the time being, investors are buying stocks on lower yields. Yields have rapidly dropped on softer economic data.

JOLTS report came at 8.059M vs. 8.34M consensus.
Factory orders came at 0.7% vs. 0.6% consensus.
Automatic Data Processing Inc (NASDAQ: ADP) is the largest payroll processor in the country and uses its data to give an advanced glimpse of the jobs picture ahead of the official jobs report. ADP payrolls came at 152K vs. 175K consensus.


Initial jobless claims will be released Thursday at 8:30am ET providing more data.
Looking ahead, the most important data is the jobs report, known as the mother of all reports, that will be released on Friday at 8:30am ET.
The momo crowd always believes that bad news is good news and good news is great news.  However, prudent investors need to remember that the momo crowd is only one group in the stock market. In contrast to the momo crowd, smart money looks ahead knowing that “bad news is good news” works only as long as earnings hold up.  Historically, when economic data starts showing weakness, earnings get hit, leading to a drop in the stock market.  
History shows that somewhere along the way, a transition happens from “bad news is good news” to “bad news is bad news.” Stay tuned to The Arora Report – we will share with you when the transition starts occurring. In the meanwhile, consider continuing to follow the protection band which is bullishly positioned relative to its benchmark.

Beat In The Cards:  The big debate between bears and bulls, coming into 2024 was around monetization of the AI revolution, said Ives in a note. Investors were seeking proof for enterprise spending ramping up to justify the valuations of AI-levered stocks, he said.
Big techs such as Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and others confirmed over the last few weeks that “AI monetization is now well underway hitting the shores of the tech sector,” he said, adding that this completed the first part of the puzzle.
Ives also noted that there have been eye-popping and impressive developer conferences from OpenAI, Google and Microsoft over the last week and Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:Full story available on Benzinga.com","Long Ideas,News,Analyst Color,Earnings,Equities,Previews,Top Stories,Markets,Tech,Trading Ideas"

As we navigate through the first half of 2024, he pointed to one area that stands out prominently: artificial intelligence (AI) and its transformative potential across various industries.
AI: The Game Changer For 2024
Schwartz highlighted that global corporations are investing heavily in computing infrastructure, with over $100 billion being allocated annually. 
“We are also observing the emergence of superior chatbots and ""CoPilots"" that optimize existing software as well as conversations about how AI has the potential to increase productivity across nearly every industry,” said Schwartz. 
These advancements underscore AI’s potential to boost productivity across nearly every sector, a trend that investors cannot afford to overlook.
Thematic ETFs: Diversified Exposure To AI
To capture alpha from AI’s potential, Schwartz advocates that “investors can get diverse exposure to AI, beyond the likes of Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) that so many others are focusing on.”

What Happened: ETF company Roundhill Investments was the first to market with several thematic investment vehicles including a sports betting ETF, launched in 2020.
In December 2021, Roundhill launched a meme stock ETF aimed at capturing interest in meme stocks, which grew in popularity during the early months of the year.
The ETF, which had the appropriate MEME ticker, closed in November 2023. Roundhill Investments CEO Dave Mazza told Benzinga the ETF was closed ""due to lack of assets under management and limited trading volume.""
With meme stocks gaining interest once again, Benzinga reached out to find out what it would take to bring the ETF back.

Cooler Inflation Data
Please click here for an enlarged chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows that the stock market is breaking out above the resistance zone.
The chart shows a highly unusual occurrence – RSI is at 100. This is the most extreme overbought level. The extreme overbought level indicates that either the stock market is ready for another strong up leg, or the breakout is going to fail.
Sentiment is extremely positive. At extremes, sentiment is a contrary indicator. In plain English, extreme positive sentiment is a sell signal. However, it is important to remember that sentiment is not a precise timing indicator.
In The Arora report analysis, based on the other macro and fundamental data, there is about a 40% probability that the breakout will fail even though technicals are very strong.
Consumer Price Index (CPI) came slightly cooler than expected. Here are the details:

Headline CPI came at 0.3% vs. 0.4% consensus.
Core CPI came at 0.3% vs. 0.3% consensus.


As most investors are elated over the CPI number, prudent investors need to remember that on an annualized basis, core CPI is still 3.6%. The Fed’s target is 2%. Further, prudent investors need to remember that goods inflation is coming down due to over production in China, but services inflation is still sticky.   
The U.S. economy is 70% consumer based. For this reason, prudent investors pay attention to retail sales. Here is the latest retail sales data.

Headline retail sales came at 0.0% vs. 0.4% consensus.
Retail sales ex-auto came at 0.2% vs. 0.2% consensus.


Retail sales data shows that the consumer is finally pulling back. This will negatively impact earnings. In the long run, the single best determinant of the stock market is earnings. However, at least for today, elated investors are not thinking far ahead about earnings.
It is said that copper has a Ph.D. in economics. That is why it is called Dr. Copper.  When the economy is booming, demand for copper goes up. In recessions, demand for copper drops. Copper futures in New York just hit a new high. Copper is also heavily used in electric vehicles and solar panels. Heavy demand for electricity by artificial intelligence data centers will also increase copper demand.
In The Arora Report analysis, the new high in copper is ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","News,Cryptocurrency,Commodities,Economics,Markets,General"

Hotter Inflation Data
Please click here for an enlarged chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows the stock market is in the resistance zone.
As is their pattern, the momo crowd was buying ahead of the release of the Producer Price Index (PPI) on hope strategy.
The momo crowd’s hopes were dashed when PPI data came much hotter than expected. Here are the details:

Headline PPI came at 0.5% vs. 0.3% consensus.
Core PPI came at 0.5% vs. 0.2% consensus.


The chart shows the stock market first dipped on bad inflation data, but as of this writing in the premarket, the momo crowd is aggressively buying the dip.
Prudent investors, in The Arora Report analysis, would want to wait to see Consumer Price Index (CPI) data tomorrow before taking any action. CPI will be released tomorrow at 8:30am ET.
The Arora Report previously shared that the Fed’s second blunder has loosened financial conditions way beyond where they should be based on the economic data.
The Fed’s blunder is now showing up in meme stocks roaring back. Earlier this morning, GameStop Corp (NYSE: GME) was up 163% in the premarket on top of 74% gain yesterday.
The meme crowd ran up AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE: AMC) 156% this morning, trading as high as $13.30 in the premarket. AMC took advantage of the meme crowd to raise about $250M of new capital by selling shares at $3.45. When the company is selling shares at $3.45, why would the meme crowd buy the same shares at $13.30?  The answer is the meme crowd is not doing any analysis other than becoming a meme to cause a short squeeze.
The last meme craze ended in tears for the meme crowd with big losses. As full disclosure, The Arora Report gave a number of successful, short term signals on meme stocks, taking advantage of previous crazes. If the ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","News,Penny Stocks,Cryptocurrency,Commodities,Small Cap,Economics,Markets"

For those unfamiliar, Gill is a pivotal figure in the meme stock phenomenon that took the financial world by storm in early 2021. As an individual investor and financial analyst, he became famous for his role in the explosive rise of GameStop Inc. (NASDAQ:GME)’s stock price.
The struggling video game retailer saw its shares soar from under $20 to nearly $500 at their peak in January 2021, largely driven by a short squeeze on investors who had bet against the stock amid weak fundamentals. 
Unlike traditional stocks, which are influenced by fundamental analysis and corporate performance, meme stocks are often subject to rapid price changes driven by hype and mass trading actions.
Gill chronicled his investment journey across various platforms, including YouTube and Reddit, notably under the username u/DeepF******Value on the subreddit r/WallStreetBets. His philosophy is emblematic of a broader narrative about meme stocks and the democratization of investing, illustrating how individual investors can unite to disrupt the financial status quo of seasoned and ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","Equities,Cryptocurrency,Social Media,Large Cap,Mid Cap,Specialty ETFs,Psychology,Small Cap,Top Stories,Trading Ideas,ETFs"

Buying On Rising Layoffs
Please click here for an enlarged chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows that the stock market has vigorously risen from the recent pullback.
The chart shows that RSI reached oversold levels during the recent pullback and now has risen to touch the lower band of the overbought zone.  Historically, this setup leads to more stock market gains.
The chart shows that the volume during the recent rise is not heavy.  This indicates lack of conviction.
The chart shows that the stock market is now in the resistance zone.
In The Arora Report analysis, stops of the short sellers are right above the resistance zone.  If the stock market rises further, Wall Street’s hunt and destroy algorithms will kick in, taking out the stops of short sellers and igniting a short squeeze. The result of such a scenario would be a new stock market high.  
Yesterday in the Morning Capsule we shared with you:

Jobless claims came at 231K vs. 213K consensus. This indicates that the job market is beginning to slow.


The bulls latched on to the rise in jobless claims and aggressively bought stocks. There is merit to this line of thinking because Powell is already itching to cut rates and rising layoffs will give him an excuse to cut rates.
Prudent investors need to be somewhat careful as weekly jobless claims series is very volatile.
For proper analysis at The Arora Report, in addition to the weekly data, we look at a four week moving average of initial jobless claims.  The four week moving average is now at 215K – up 2.26% from the prior week and down 10.14% from a year ago.  Considering the size of the U.S. economy, a rise of 2.26% over the prior week is hardly meaningful, but do not tell that to trigger happy stock market bulls.  Prudent investors should watch the trend over a period of several weeks, not just one week. Jobless claims is a leading indicator and carries heavy weight in The Arora Report adaptive ZYX Asset Allocation Model with inputs in ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","Cryptocurrency,Asia,Commodities,Economics,Markets"

Reduce Hedges And Deploy Cash
Hedges are profitable. It is time to take more partial profits. It is time to deploy slightly more cash.

Fed’s Favorite Inflation Gauge

Note the following:

The chart shows that the stock market is consolidating between the resistance zone and support zone.
RSI on the chart shows that the stock market can go either way from here.
This morning, the stock market dodged a big bullet. The bullet was the fear that PCE, the Fed’s favorite inflation gauge, would come higher than the consensus. The data came inline with the consensus. Here are the details:

Headline PCE came at 0.3% vs. 0.3% consensus.
Core PCE came at 0.3% vs. 0.3% consensus.


The PCE data just released has proven that The Arora Report call has been spot on. The Arora Report call has been that inflation is coming from services and is sticky. Digging below the headline, the just released data shows that inflation is coming from services and is sticky.
Momo gurus have been forecasting that inflation would have gone down to 2% by now. If you annualize 0.3%, it translates to 3.6%. The momo gurus are wrong again. Even though momo gurus are almost always wrong, prudent investors should not ignore them. The reason is that the media promotes momo gurus because they boost ratings. Momo gurus have legions of followers who do not do any analysis and just follow the momo gurus like sheep.
The U.S. economy is 70% consumer based. Therefore, prudent investors pay attention to personal income and personal spending. Consumers continue to excessively spend. This is helping the economy and ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","Cryptocurrency,Commodities,Economics,Markets,Trading Ideas"

What Happened: Gerber took to X, formerly Twitter, on Thursday to express his views on the tech sector’s earnings reports. He believes that the consistent trend of these reports points towards a significant increase in AI infrastructure spending. He also emphasized the potential benefits for companies involved in AI infrastructure.
Gerber’s post comes at a time when the tech sector is experiencing a surge in AI-related activities.

AI giants Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) set a positive tone for tech companies with strong performances in the first quarter.
However, the focus will likely shift to the annual inflation rate, as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE), the Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge. This data, released as part of the personal income and spending report at 8:30 am ET, could provide a double boost to the market. A reading in line with or below expectations could help break the recent lackluster performance.
The PCE data is particularly important because the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the Fed’s policy-setting arm, meets next Wednesday. The futures market currently prices in a 97% chance of the Fed holding rates steady.

Despite this positive revenue performance, Meta Platforms’ shares declined by 15% in after-market trading due to lower-than-expected revenue in the first quarter and a slightly disappointing outlook for the second quarter, coupled with increased expenses and capital expenditure forecasts for 2024.
Read: Meta Platforms Stock Is Tumbling Thursday: What’s Going On?
Meta expects operating losses for its Reality Labs division to significantly rise year-over-year. Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s founder and CEO, expressed optimism, citing progress in AI development and metaverse building efforts.
Here’s what analysts have said about the earnings report.
JPMorgan On Meta
Analyst Doug Anmuth reiterated his Overweight rating on Meta while reducing the price target from $535 to $480 a share.
“Meta is more optimistic & ambitious on AI than ever, and believes it can become the leading AI company in the world,” said Anmuth.
To this end, Meta’s management anticipates challenges in the coming months, including tough comparisons from 2023 regarding China advertiser spending, Reels monetization and engagement trends. Despite these challenges, Meta remains optimistic about its AI initiatives, believing they will yield significant long-term benefits. 
“We are encouraged that Meta's success w/Llama 3 and Meta AI has increased management's confidence in leading in AI,” he noted.
The company’s strong competitive position, focus on user experience and strategic alignment with AI and the metaverse suggest a promising future, per Anmuth. 
Despite the increased spending, analysts project double-digit revenue and EPS growth for Meta in 2025 and 2026, given its history of driving returns on investment.
Wedbush On Meta
Analyst Scott Devitt had an Outperform rating on Meta. Devitt too, reduced his price target on the stock from $570 to $480 a share.
Meta is “in the early stages of a multi-year investment cycle to support metaverse and AI initiatives that willlikely take several years to scale adoption and monetization,” said Devitt.
Wedbush has adjusted its profit forecasts to account for Meta’s accelerated expense growth and increased capital expenditure in the coming years. For the near term, Devitt thinks “the setup will be challenging” and sees limited upside.
On a relative basis, Wedbush favors Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google (Outperform, Best Idea), within the group.
Needham On Meta
Analyst Laura Martin had an Underperform rating on Meta and no price target. Her recommendation: “use Meta as a source of funds,” implying investors should sell the stock as opposed to buying it.
Martin is skeptical about buying Meta stock for several reasons. 

Meta’s management suggests it is in a two- to three-year investment cycle before revenue growth materializes, which raises concerns about the stock’s potential.

The U.S. economy grew by a 1.6% annualized pace in Q1 2024, slowing down sharply from the 3.4% pace in the previous quarter and missing expectations of a growth rate of 2.5%.

(NASDAQ:META) and concerning economic indicators arising from the first-quarter gross domestic product release.
What Happened: Meta Platforms outperformed Wall Street's expectations with first-quarter revenue of $36.45 billion, a 27% increase year-over-year, and earnings per share of $4.71, beating the predicted $4.32. Investors pulled back after the social media giant issued subdued guidance for the upcoming quarter. 
The company’s forecast for the second quarter anticipates revenue between $36.5 billion and $39 billion, putting the lower end of the range below the consensus estimate of $38.3 billion. 
Additionally, the social media giant anticipates increases in infrastructure and legal costs — pushing full-year expenses to between $96 billion and $99 billion.

Cues From Past Session:
Early optimism triggered by positive reactions to earnings from Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Texas Instruments, Inc. (NASDAQ:TXN) tempered over the course of Wednesday’s session. Mixed earnings reports and economic worries kept sentiment subdued for much of the session, and this led to a mixed close for the day.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 Index ended the session marginally higher, pulling notably off the day’s high reached in early trading.

(NASDAQ:META) as a key player in the crowded AI space.
What Happened: During “Last Call” CNBC on Wednesday, Greenfield highlighted that Meta’s commitment to AI investments comes at a time when the space has become “crowded” with competition from ChatGPT by Microsoft and OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic, Perplexity.AI and more. 
""There is no doubt that $META is going to be a major player. I think the challenge for investors is one, how big is this investment cycle, given the level of competition, "" Greenfield said.

SMCI shares are trading relatively in line with its infrastructure peer group at 27x calendar 2024 P/E vs. peers’ 28x average. The 27x for SMCI compares to 17x for low gross margin peers, but he noted Super Micro’s faster growth warrants near-term premium. 
Super Micro, a leading ODM/OEM of IT infrastructure (compute, storage, networking, liquid cooling), is well positioned to benefit from secular AI growth trends provided its ability to deliver highly customized complete IT solutions leveraging its in-house engineering design expertise based on the latest technology (i.e., GPUs) in the fastest, most efficient manner, Blakey noted.
The opportunity set may extend as AI becomes more pervasive over time, driving the theme of accelerated computing where relative bespoke GPU-based solutions and other and non-x86 (i.e., Arm Holdings Plc (NASDAQ: ARM)) solutions take share in what the CEO of Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) has recently described as a $1 trillion installed base opportunity currently based chiefly on x86 CPUs and ASICs.
Blakey estimates that Super Micro will reach an approximately 23% share of the AI server market in calendar 2024, with competitive moats that should sustain, if not expand, this share in coming years.

A lot is riding on the earnings reports of companies like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (GOOG).
The Season So Far: The percentage of S&P 500 companies that have reported positive earning surprises and the magnitude of earnings surprises are at or above their 10-year averages, said FactSet in its report released Friday. That said, substantial downward revisions to earnings per share (EPS) estimates of two healthcare companies have led to a decline in earnings growth over the past two weeks.
The combined earnings per share growth rate of S&P 500 companies, considering both the already reported actual results and the estimates for those yet to report, is at 0.5%, according to FactSet. The metric, however, fell from the 0.9% estimated previous week and the 3.4% estimated at the end of the first quarter. Earnings growth for the quarter may extend the positive growth streak to three quarters.
So far, 14% of the S&P 500 companies have reported March quarter results. 
See Also: Best Tech Stocks To Buy Right Now
Look Ahead: The upcoming week will likely feature earnings releases from 158 S&P 500 companies, including 11 Dow 30 components. With the bank earnings tapering off, the spotlight shifts to tech companies, as they begin to roll out their quarterly scorecard this week.
Apart from some big techs, which are part of the group called the “Magnificent Seven,” homebuilders, defense contractors, airlines and transportation companies are also due to release their quarterly reports. 
All eyes are focused on Tesla as analysts expect a downbeat report from the company. Analysts see the scope of a further contraction in margin and potentially a double miss yet again in the first quarter.

While index futures on Friday clawed back some earlier losses, sentiment remains fragile following Israel’s missile strikes on Iran in response to drone attacks and as explosions were reported in Syria and Iraq.
Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), the first major tech company to report earnings, disappointed investors with comments about ending membership guidance. Investors may also turn their attention to upcoming regional bank earnings reports. With commodities retreating from their initial spikes and bond yields falling, a potential reversal in sentiment remains in play despite the extended decline.
The session will also likely see volatility as options contracts tied to about $3 trillion in stocks, equity indexes, and exchange-traded funds expire on Friday.

A New Opportunity In AI Ahead
Please click here for an enlarged chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500.
Note the following:

The chart shows that the stock market has pulled back after breaking below the trendline.  
The chart shows the support zone.  
The chart shows that in spite of the pullback, the stock market is still about 5% above the support zone.  
Powell had repeatedly made it clear that he was itching to cut interest rates. This is what initially triggered the stock market rally in 2023 and kept the stock market rally going in 2024.  
When inflation data from January came hotter than expected, the hot inflation data went against Powell, but Powell dismissed it as a one-off. The hot inflation data for February again went against Powell, but Powell again dismissed it as a one-off.
The chart shows when CPI data was reported for January, February, and March.   
When the March inflation data came against Powell, prudent investors were eagerly awaiting how Powell would justify rate cuts after data went against him three months in a row. Powell has now shifted, saying that it will take longer to be confident about inflation. Powell acknowledged that progress on inflation has stalled. Powell now expects to hold interest rates at the current level longer than he previously expected.  
In the stock market, there was a short dip on Powell’s statement. The momo crowd aggressively bought the dip. This morning, the momo crowd continues to aggressively buy stocks.  
Due to the importance of Powell’s switch and the consequences of Powell’s error over the last several months to investors.
As the day and the week progresses, prudent investors need to stay alert to how the market reacts to earnings. Earnings season is in full swing. So far, earnings are mixed. Prudent investors should also stay in tune with what smart money does. As a reminder, when the momo crowd aggressively bought stocks after Iran attacked Israel, smart money took advantage of the strength generated by the momo crowd to trim stocks.

Elevated interest rates and a widespread trend toward reducing office space across various industries have left the sector facing unprecedented amounts of vacant office space.
On an earnings call on Monday, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS) CEO David M. Solomon mentioned the poor state of commercial real estate as one of the main factors slowing U.S. growth, along with continuing concerns about inflation and escalating geopolitical tensions.
The sector has become especially sensitive to speculation around interest rates. Last month, a hint of rate cuts by the Fed had several stocks and funds jump through the roof in a show of volatility that's unknown to a sector normally praised for offering stability against riskier markets.
Just days later, S&P Global Inc (NYSE:SPGI) decided to downgrade five regional banks based on risks associated with the unstable commercial real estate market.
Operational shifts for big tech companies are partly fueling the commercial real estate slump. The change to remote or hybrid work, which has become the new status quo in the tech sector after the strike of COVID-19, has left many companies juggling more office space than they need.

Extraordinary Move In Treasuries
Please click here for an enlarged chart of 20+ year Treasury bond ETF (NASDAQ: TLT).
Note the following:

The chart shows that TLT has fallen below the support/resistance zone. This prior support zone has now become a resistance zone.
The chart shows that after a breakdown below the zone, Treasuries have continued to fall.
The chart shows a downward sloping trendline and a significant move lower away from the trendline.
The chart shows that the down move is on heavy volume. This indicates conviction.
Historically, at a time of geopolitical tension, money rushes into U.S. Treasuries, and U.S. Treasuries rocket up. Based on history, on Iran attacking Israel, U.S. Treasuries should have moved up. But as the chart shows, Treasuries have continued to move down.
In The Arora Report analysis, Treasuries moving down in spite of the Iranian attack on Israel is quite extraordinary. 
Prudent investors pay attention when something extraordinary happens in the markets.  
Lower Treasuries mean lower stock valuations. All investors should fully grasp this point.  
As is their pattern, the momo crowd is oblivious to this extraordinary development and is buying stocks. The momo crowd’s buy the dip without analysis mentality is on full display.
Fed Chair Powell has been itching to cut interest rates. Clearly, the bond market is not only defying him, but it is telling him he is wrong. Powell will be participating in a Q&A. We will be paying close attention to what he says.

Wall Street seems to be coming around. A major bank is accepting the real risk of a rate hike. Of course, members and readers of The Arora Report, already knew in advance that the data could force the Fed’s hand to raise rates at a time when everyone expects rate cuts.
Lower Treasury bonds mean higher yields in the U.S. Higher yields mean a higher dollar.

Oil is most sensitive to developments in the Middle East.
The chart shows that oil is falling after an Iranian attack on Israel.
The chart shows that oil is consolidating around the upper trendline.
The best of all scenarios is playing out in the Middle East.

Although there are contradictory reports, it is near certain that Iran informed Turkey and Turkey informed the U.S. of the Iranian attack in advance.
The reason Iran informed the U.S. in advance is because Iran’s purpose was to show force and save face but not inflict much damage and for the U.S. to restrain Israel.
The advance notice allowed the U.S. and Israel to shoot down 99% of about 300 drones and missiles, resulting in very little damage.
Iran issued several statements that the operation was concluded.
Biden is working hard to restrain Israel.
Not only is oil down, stocks are being aggressively bought on the best Middle East scenario being played out.


In The Arora Report analysis, Iran’s response to directly attack Israel has increased risks in the long term, especially without a robust response from Israel.
Further, in The Arora Report analysis, Iran is buying time to build its nuclear capability.

He expects tech stocks to rally 15% in 2024.
What Happened: Ives, who has been bullish about the tech sector, thinks a multitude of factors have aligned to make the first-quarter earnings ""robust.""
""I think this is going to be a robust tech earnings season next few weeks.""
While Nvidia Corp.'s (NASDAQ:NVDA) Jensen Huang and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) are leading the ""AI revolution,"" Ives believes other companies are contributing to the second, third, and fourth-order derivatives of ""$1 trillion spending"" over the next decade, driving the growth in spending and advancing technology, too.
The broader technology index, the Nasdaq Composite, has experienced choppiness over the last month. While the Nasdaq is up 9.54% year-to-date, in the last month, it is up by just 1.26%.

Raise Cash
It is time to increase cash by 4%. Hedges were recently raised. Please see the protection band section below.
The bull market is intact, but the probability of a pullback has gone up. As full disclosure, the tentative plan for The Arora Report is to buy the pullback.  
Hotter Inflation 
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows that the stock market has broken the upward sloping trendline that has defined the rally.
The chart shows the Arora call to raise hedges prior to the drop.
The chart shows the support zone from which the breakout occurred. The tentative plan is to buy if the stock market pulls back to the support zone. However, this will need to be adjusted – read the next point.
The probability of the stock market pulling back to the support zone is less than 50%. The reason is that the buy the dip crowd is already aggressively buying the dip and is prepared to aggressively buy more.  
The new data shows that inflation is hotter than expected. Here are the details:

Headline CPI came at 0.4% vs. 0.3% consensus.
Core CPI came at 0.4% vs. 0.3% consensus.


As a reference, the new data equates to inflation at an annualized rate of 4.8%. The Fed’s target is 2%.
In The Arora Report analysis, this time, the momo gurus are going to have difficulty persuading their followers to buy stocks. One reason is that momo gurus have been wrong at every step of the way this year.  Having said that, do not underestimate the cleverness of momo gurus to come up with a new narrative to persuade investors to buy stocks.  At the same time, do not underestimate the power of greed in the momo crowd. The momo crowd is very easy to influence because at best, the ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","Cryptocurrency,Commodities,Economics,Markets,General"

A significant factor contributing to the outperformance of energy stocks since the year’s onset has been the sharp increase in oil prices.
The West Texas Intermediate (WTI) light crude, tracked by the United States Oil Fund (NYSE:USO), has risen by 20% year to date. This surge can be attributed to a combination of factors including growing demand, limited OPEC+ supply, and escalating tensions in the Middle East, particularly between Israel and Iran.
According to the latest forecast from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the Brent crude oil spot price is expected to average $90 per barrel in the second quarter of 2024, which ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","Equities,Large Cap,Specialty ETFs,Commodities,Global,Econ #s,Top Stories,ETFs"

Bar Neither High Nor Low: Unlike in the fourth quarter reporting season, when consensus estimates came down by 6.8% between October and December, the picture is different this quarter, said LPL Financial Chief Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder in his preview.
This time around, the consensus was cut by just 2.5% between January and March, and therefore the bar wasn’t so low, he said.
The analyst sees the typical three to four percentage-point upside to current estimates as achievable, potentially propelling S&P 500 earnings per share growth for the quarter to about 6%.
Positives And Pushbacks: Buchbinder threw in some data points to lend credence to his view that the economic fundamentals were firming up and these include:

Bloomberg-tracked consensus GDP growth estimate rising from 0.5% to 2% since the start of 2024
Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing purchasing managers’ index jumping into expansion territory in March

Hot Jobs Report

Note the following:

The chart shows that the stock market has broken below the upward sloping trendline.
The chart shows that was a perfect setup for the stock market to drop yesterday when Israel went on high alert due to the prospect of Iranian retaliation.  
As is their pattern, the momo crowd was buying stocks this morning ahead of the mother of all numbers, the jobs report, on hope strategy.
Jobs report came much hotter than expected. Here are the details:

Non-farm payrolls came at 303K vs 200K consensus.  This indicates that the economy is strong and a large number of new jobs are being created.  The vast majority of these jobs are at the low end such as in hospitality. Jobs remain weak in information technology as more workers are replaced by AI.
Nonfarm private payrolls came at 232K vs 160K consensus.  This indicates that there is no need to cut interest rates at this time.
Unemployment rate came at 3.8% vs 3.8% consensus.  The unemployment rate remains low.
Average hourly earnings came at 0.3% vs 0.3% consensus.  This indicates that reducing inflation from here will be difficult.
Average work week came at 34.4 vs 34.3 consensus.


The stock market briefly lost the gains but the momo crowd aggressively bought the dip.
In The Arora Report analysis, the hot jobs report is reducing the probability of rate cuts starting in June.  Keep in mind that momo gurus claim to know for sure that rate cuts will start in June.  You may remember that the same momo gurus knew for sure that there would be six rate cuts this year starting in March.  Clearly, momo gurus have been wrong.  However, prudent investors need to understand that momo gurus ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","Economics,Markets"

“The first quarter marked the index’s second-consecutive quarter of double digit gains for only the ninth time since 1940. Historically, this has been a bullish signal, as the prior eight occurrences were all followed by positive 12 month gains.”

Investor sentiment is buoyed by hopes that the economy may skirt a severe recession and anticipations of potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The burgeoning excitement around artificial intelligence technologies has also played a role in bolstering market optimism.

How long will the party last? What are the risks involved in investing in an overbought market? Benzinga collated views from analysts and economists to make sense of the rally so far and zero in on the opportunities that could pay off in the near to medium term.
Equity Market — From Shaky Start To Strong Surge: The equity market kicked off the new year with a whimper, with concerns that 2023’s gains might not hold. However, the momentum from last year carried through, quashing skepticism and propelling the market to new highs.
Three months in, the S&P 500 Index has notched record highs for both closing and intraday trading. Blue-chip stocks mirrored this performance, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing the quarter at a fresh record. 
Tech stocks were once again at the forefront, fueled by the AI boom that spurred gains for companies of all sizes. However, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite couldn’t quite reach its record peak as valuation concerns prompted some profit-taking near the quarter’s end.

                               Source: Benzinga 
The more heartening aspect of the recent rally is that, unlike in 2023 when it was nearly exclusively fueled by tech, this time around, the participation has broadened. 
LPL Financial‘s Chief Technical Strategist, Adam Turnquist, said in a recent note that the strong uptrend in the S&P 500 Index is supported by broad participation and cyclical leadership. “Improving relative strength in industrials, financials, and materials provides additional evidence of a bullish rotation that has largely been overshadowed by mega-caps and AI enthusiasm,” he said.

AI optimism drove much of the upside early in the quarter, with stocks such as Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) — the ones at the forefront of the revolution — clocking strong gains for the year. In the latter half, stocks received support from the Fed leaning toward rate cuts.","Long Ideas,News,Analyst Color,Equities,Short Sellers,Cryptocurrency,Education,Commodities,Top Stories,Analyst Ratings,Tech,Trading Ideas"

According to Harlan Sur, an analyst at JPMorgan, the landscape for semiconductor companies catering to networking and optical sectors presents promising opportunities. 
“Bottom line, the AI-driven networking/optical demand outlook remains strong through next year,” Sur wrote in a research note.

What Happened: On Monday, Sarat Sethi of Douglas C. Lane & Associates commented on the current market trends. He observed that as the market rallies broadly, the major tech stocks known as the ‘Magnificent 7’ are not participating in the surge. Instead, retail speculators are turning their attention to other areas of the market.
""It's the greater fool theory: who’s going to be the last one holding the bag? These are not fundamental companies. Most of them are not even making money at this point,” Sethi added.
“So the question is when you do get a pullback in the market…these stocks are going to have a huge beta. They are not just going to go down by one or two percent, they could go down in double digits at that point.”

What Happened: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill Monday that bans the use of social media platforms for children 13 or under. The legislation also requires parental permission for those that are between the ages of 14 and 15.
The bill passed the Florida legislature earlier this month with bipartisan support.
For social media giants like Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), parent company of Instagram and Facebook, as well as Beijing-based TikTok owner Bytedance, it’s bad news.
Bytedance is already facing massive scrutiny from the federal government under a bill that could force the company to sell its U.S. operations to a local buyer or face a complete shutdown in the country.
The main argument behind the newly-signed bill is backed by rising levels of anxiety, depression and addiction to social media amongst teenagers, which many commentators have blamed a lack of action by the platforms themselves, and purposely addictive design.

The bill did not clarify which companies will be affected by its language. But, it's expected that Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP) and X, formerly Twitter, will also be amongst those affected.

Ark Invest’s acquisition of META shares comes as the company faces possible fresh litigation. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled against the Mark Zuckerberg-led company, allowing a class action lawsuit to proceed. Advertisers had accused the company of exaggerating the potential reach of its ads on Facebook and Instagram, as reported by Bloomberg Law.

AI Memory Sold Out
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ: MU).
Note the following:

This article is about the big picture, not an individual stock. The chart of MU stock is being used to illustrate the point.  As a full disclosure, MU stock is in The Arora Report ZYX Buy Portfolio.
Micron is the largest U.S. semiconductor memory maker.
The chart shows a powerful breakout to the upside after Micron reported earnings.
The most important item from earnings for investors is that high bandwidth memory is sold out for 2024. High bandwidth memory is used in artificial intelligence applications.
In The Arora Report analysis, Micron is likely to ship $600M - $800M worth of high bandwidth memory for AI applications in 2024. As investors understand the need for high bandwidth memory, the PE of MU stock is likely to expand.
The Arora Report is raising the target on MU. 
It is not just AI. The demand for memory is increasing, and prices are increasing.
Here are the important details from Micron earnings that investors should pay attention to:

Q2 EPS came at $0.42 vs. a consensus of a loss of $0.25.
Q2 revenue came at $5.82B vs. $5.34B consensus.
Micron projects Q3 EPS of $0.38 - $0.52 vs. $0.20 consensus.


The Fed has turned ultra dovish, risking inflation. The Fed has shrugged off hot inflation data. Please see yesterday’s Afternoon Capsule for details.
The Fed turning ultra dovish is an important subject that all investors should deeply understand for their own financial well being. The easiest way to understand is with the analogy of a car. The U.S. government is pushing the accelerator pedal to the floor with reckless spending on the fiscal side. The Fed has been applying the breaks.  Now, the Fed has lifted its foot off of the breaks.  
Sentiment is extremely positive. Keep in mind that when sentiment is extremely positive, it is a contrary indicator.
As an actionable item, the sum total of the foregoing is in the protection band, which strikes the optimum balance between various crosscurrents. Please scroll down to see the ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","Economics,Federal Reserve,Markets,Tech"

Fed Quandary
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart is a weekly chart to give investors a longer term perspective.
The chart shows that the trendline is still intact.
The momo crowd is going to continue to buy unless there is a sustained breakdown below the trendline for more than one week.
The chart shows two weekly dojis. The doji is a candle pattern where opening and closing prices are very close to each other. A doji pattern indicates indecision. The chart shows two weeks of indecision.
The latest candle shown on the chart is only for a partial week as of this writing. The Fed decision later today will determine how the candle for this week develops.
The two weekly dojis are instructive in that the general belief is that the stock market is running up, but the two dojis on the chart say otherwise.
The FOMC statement will be released at 2pm ET today followed by Powell’s press conference at 2:30pm ET.
The momo crowd has continued to aggressively buy stocks. The momo gurus want the Fed to bow to them and start cutting rates, or at a minimum clearly indicate that rate cuts are coming soon.
Prudent investors need to understand that the Fed and momo gurus have very different objectives.

The momo gurus’ sole objective is to run up the stock market in the short term in the disguise of analysis.
The Fed has a dual mandate – price stability and maximum employment.
The Fed is concerned about the long term economy of the entire U.S.  Momo gurus are only concerned about the stock market in the short term.  


The Fed faces several problems:

The last two CPI numbers and the last PPI number were hotter than expected. The data shows that inflation is not coming down as the Fed had hoped.
The economy is staying stronger than the Fed had hoped in view of high interest rates.
Financial conditions have become easier in spite of the Fed keeping rates high.
Easier financial conditions make it difficult to control inflation.

Adam Kobeissi, author of The Kobeissi Letter on X said on Tuesday: “Even as three interest rate cuts were removed from market forecasts, the S&P 500 is just 10 points away from a new all time high.”
Why has there been such a disconnect between interest rates and equity markets? Let’s look at the evidence in the chart of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPY) the exchange traded fund that closely tracks the percentage performance of the U.S. large-cap index.

The event, dubbed as the “AI Woodstock” by Bank of America analysts, underscored the growing excitement around artificial intelligence (AI) and its potential to reshape the technology landscape.
Bank of America’s Vivek Arya highlighted the increasing influence of generative AI and the concept of omniverse/digital twins across a broad spectrum of industries. 
Arya suggested the potential to re-architect a staggering $1-$2 trillion of global computing infrastructure with accelerators, envisioning a market that could grow to $250-$500 billion annually over the next three to five years. This expansion is further supported by growing enterprise use cases and demand from various sovereign entities.
This optimistic view led the investment bank to raise its price target for Nvidia from $925 to $1,100, showcasing a stronger-than-consesus call on the major AI player.

Under the leadership of Jensen Huang, Nvidia will likely reveal groundbreaking products, partnerships, and use cases that will propel the next phase of the AI Revolution, as per the analyst. 
The event will likely set off a tidal wave of spending in the tech sector, with a forecast of over $1 trillion in AI investments over the next decade, he said. 
This surge reflected the proliferation of enterprise and consumer applications in what is being termed the 4th Industrial Revolution.

The covered call ETF that came out on top was the NEOS S&P 500 High Income ETF for three reasons: they had full exposure to the holdings inside of the S&P 500, wrote out-of-the-money covered calls, and used Section 1256 contracts for enhanced tax-efficiency. 
The total performance of SPYI in 2023 was 18.1%, capturing nearly 69% of the S&P 500 Index's total return last year. Compared to the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF's total return of 9.8%, and the GlobalX S&P 500 Covered Call ETF's total return of 11.0%.
I share these figures because the team that built SPYI — and all of the category leading performance that came with it — has used the same techniques and strategy to build the NEOS Nasdaq-100 High Income ETF (NASDAQ: QQQI).
What Is QQQI?
The NEOS Nasdaq-100 High Income ETF is an ETF that aims to offer high monthly income in a tax-efficient manner and upside potential when the Nasdaq-100 Index (QQQ) rises. 
Let’s break that down simply — as we all know, an ETF is a basket of stocks.
In this case, the basket is constructed to replicate the holdings of the Nasdaq-100 Index. Remember, the Nasdaq-100 Index sits right next to the S&P 500 Index in popularity and portfolio construction. This index tracks the total performance of the 100 largest, most-actively traded stocks listed on the Nasdaq. Think Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)… you get the picture.
The Nasdaq-100 Index delivered +54.9% returns for its investors in 2023, the best year since 1999. Again, this was largely due to the AI craze we saw by companies like Microsoft, Nvidia, and others — but incredibly impressive nonetheless.
So, what's the difference between QQQ and QQQI?
A single letter, I.
And that letter stands for income. 
Think about it like this — a 55% return in an investment is awesome. However, to realize that return in your bank account, you’ll need to sell shares of stock. Considering the trailing twelve month dividend yield of the Nasdaq-100 Index is 0.52%, 99.48% of that return was in the form of share price appreciation — not cash dividends paid to you.
But what if there was an ETF that aimed to offer exposure to the Nasdaq-100 Index while also optimizing for tax-efficient income for their shareholders?
Enter QQQI. 
The NEOS team has successfully done this with their S&P 500 Index equivalent ETF, SPYI — paying a 12.14% annual distribution yield (as of 3/15/24) to investors while ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","Trading Ideas,ETFs"

Not so, said analysts at Goldman Sachs this week, as earnings growth expectations warrant current lofty share price gains.
While Nvidia returned 522% since the start of 2022 and 84% year-to-date, Goldman analyst Ryan Hammond said the company’s price/earnings ratio was broadly unchanged since the start of 2023 with nearly all its return attributable to a higher stream of earnings.
For the sector, fears of a bubble could be largely discounted, he said. Three-year earnings growth expectations among the largest 10 tech stocks were around 15%, lower than the 24% seen during the tech bubble of 2000, while valuations were at 28x earnings, much lower than the 52x seen in 2000.

After a strong recovery for its stock in 2023, Tesla shares have turned into one of the worst performers over the last three months.
What Happened: The S&P 500 Index has been setting new all-time high records in 2024 passing the 5,000 level.
The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), which tracks the index, is up 33.6% over the last year and up 8.3% year-to-date in 2024. The index and ETF have been helped by the performance of the Magnificent 7 stocks.
The seven stocks of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Tesla have helped boost the S&P 500 over the last year.
Year-to-date though, two of the seven key stocks are negative with Apple down 9.9% and Tesla down 34.4%. Overall, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust is up 8.3% year-to-date in 2024.
Turns out Tesla isn't just underperforming as a member of the Magnificent 7, the stock is also underperforming in the S&P 500 Index.
As of Thursday, the stock is now the worst performer in the S&P 500 Index year-to-date.

The House of Representatives on Wednesday voted in favor of a bill that would force ByteDance to either sell TikTok or face a ban in the U.S.
The bill now moves up to the Senate and, if passed there and signed by President Joe Biden, ByteDance will have five months to sell the company, or TikTok will be removed from all app stores across all formats.
The whole affair is predicated upon the notion that TikTok, because of its Chinese ownership, represents a national security threat — both in terms of the data it could potentially share with the Chinese government, and the misinformation it could spread across western democracies.
But what if the company was in U.S. hands?
Mnuchin Announces Intent To Buy
Enter two possible contenders. A group led by former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and a rival group potentially led by Bobby Kotick, former CEO of Activision Blizzard.
Following Wednesday’s House vote, Mnuchin appeared on CNBC and told presenters that he was putting together an investment group to buy TikTok.

Hotter PPI
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows that the stock market is staying above the trendline.
As long as the stock market stays above the trendline, the momo crowd is going to continue to buy stocks.
The data just released shows that the momo crowd is in AI la la land and paying no attention to the data. 
The Arora Report has been heavily focused on AI, and as a result, Arora portfolios have done extremely well. Having said that, prudent investors need to understand that when it is all said and done, AI has to prosper in the real world and not in a make believe artificial world.  Right now, the momo crowd is in AI la la land. 
Producer Price Index (PPI) shows that inflation is running hotter at the producer level than expected. Here are the details:

Headline PPI came at 0.6% vs. 0.3% consensus.
Core PPI came at 0.3% vs. 0.2% consensus.


PPI feeds directly into PCE, which is the Fed’s favorite inflation gauge. The data released today shows that the Fed needs to be very careful before cutting rates.
As The Arora Report had correctly predicted, consumer spending is beginning to weaken. The U.S. economy is 70% consumer based. For this reason, prudent investors pay attention to retail sales. Here is the latest retail sales data.

Headline retail sales came at 0.6% vs. 0.7% consensus.
Retail sales ex-auto came at 0.3% vs. 0.5% consensus.


Initial jobless claims came at 209K vs. 218K consensus.

What Happened: On Wednesday, Ives shared insights on CNBC’s Squawk on the Street about the potential repercussions of a TikTok ban for large technology firms. Ives described the situation as a “slippery slope” and a “watershed moment,” suggesting that imposing a ban is akin to “playing a little with fire.” 
When asked if Wedbush would rerate Meta and Snap higher, Ives explained that passing the bill in the House would be “incrementally positive” for other social media giants, but there is a need to wait and watch for the coming weeks.
His comments come as the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill that could lead to a ban on TikTok if its Chinese owners do not sell the app.

QQQ is above the trendline shown on the chart.
The chart shows that QQQ ran up in spite of hotter inflation data. Yesterday, gamma squeeze and AI frenzy completely overpowered inflation data that was negative for the stock market.
Prudent investors know the market cannot ignore inflation forever. While the stock market and the economy are not the same thing, they can not be completely divorced from one another.
As long as QQQ stays above the trendline shown on the chart, the rapidly increasing YOLO (you only live once) behavior in the stock market will continue. In YOLO behavior, investors give up any notion of risk.
The chart shows that if QQQ starts pulling back, the major support zone is far off.
Oracle Corp (NYSE: ORCL) earnings indicated there is a strong demand for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA) chips.
NVDA stock ran up on Oracle earnings, which pulled up other AI stocks and led the market higher.
Quadruple witching is this Friday. Quadruple witching is to the upside.
The incessant call buying by the momo crowd is leading to a gamma squeeze, putting upward pressure on the stock market. Gamma squeeze is an important market mechanic. Understanding gamma squeeze can give investors an edge.
NVDA has now totally replaced Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) as the momo crowd’s favorite stock. The momo crowd is selling TSLA and buying NVDA.
The next major trigger for the stock market will be the Nvidia GTC event that starts on March 18.

Hotter Inflation 
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows that the stock market is hovering above the trendline.
The chart shows when the Consumer Price Index (CPI) was last reported, the stock market fell as CPI was hotter than expected.
The difference between when CPI was reported last time as shown on the chart and the CPI release this time is that stock market euphoria has significantly expanded.  
The chart shows that the stock market is rising after the CPI report today.
CPI came hotter than expected. Here are the details:

Headline CPI came at 0.4% vs. 0.3% consensus and 0.2% whisper number.
Core CPI came at 0.4% vs. 0.3% consensus and 0.2% whisper number.


On a micro level, the stock market quickly dipped after the release of the hotter than expected CPI, but then the momo crowd stepped in to aggressively buy the dip.
If the stock market was in a rational phase, it would have seen a big drop today on the hotter than expected CPI. However, the stock market is in a euphoric phase. In a euphoric phase, bad news is good news, and good news is great news. A characteristic of the euphoric phase is that all news is bought, irrespective of what it is.  
Momo gurus have a new highly flawed narrative to persuade their followers to buy stocks. The narrative is that year-over-year inflation came at 3.2% vs. 3.1% consensus.
As we have shared with you several times along the way, looking solely at year-over-year is like driving while looking only in the rearview mirror. Investors should look at month-over-month for the last three months – this is like looking through the windshield. Investors should also look at year-over-year, but that is like looking through the ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","Economics,Markets,General"

The reversal in Nvidia’s stock has sparked concerns about a broader market downturn.
What Happened: On Friday, Nvidia, a major AI player, experienced a 5.5% drop, marking its worst session since late May. This decline, despite the stock reaching an all-time high earlier in the day, has raised concerns about a potential larger market pullback, reported CNBC.
Despite ending the week with a 6% gain, Nvidia’s reversal has left investors worried about the broader market’s reliance on AI stocks. Five of the “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks, excluding Nvidia and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), experienced a drop last week. This has led to concerns about a potential correction in the AI trade.

Negative Nvidia Pattern
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA).
Note the following:

This article is about the big picture, not an individual stock. The chart of NVDA is being used to illustrate the point. As a full disclosure, NVDA stock is in The Arora Report ZYX Buy Core Model Portfolio.
The chart shows that NVDA stock has traced an outside day. An outside day is a reversal pattern in traditional technical analysis.
The chart shows that The Arora Report gave a signal to partially hedge the NVDA position when NVDA was trading at $952.74, right near the very top. Since the signal to hedge NVDA stock, NVDA has lost about $250B worth of value. 
The chart shows that NVDA is long from $125.51 when NVDA stock fell in the Arora buy zone shown on the left side of the chart.
The chart shows that the reversal pattern in NVDA stock was on heavy volume. This is negative.
Nvidia is important for the following reasons.

Nvidia is the center of the artificial intelligence revolution.
Nvidia has been the best performing large cap tech stock.
About one third of S&P 500 performance is due to Nvidia.
Nvidia has become the favorite of the momo crowd, replacing Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA).
Nvidia usually has the most option volume on the call side, indicating the YOLO (you only live once) mentality that has seeped into the stock market.


The move in NVDA stock is actively impacting the entire semiconductor sector. As The Arora Report has written before, semiconductors are the leading sector. As a full disclosure, VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH) is in The Arora Report ZYX Allocation Core Model Portfolio.  Readers and members of The Arora Report had an advanced notice that semiconductors may fall from the signal given in ZYX Allocation to take partial profits in semiconductor ETF SMH just prior to the drop. That Arora signal has now proven spot on.
The next major event ahead is CPI data that will be released tomorrow morning at 8:30am ET. The consensus is 0.3% for both the headline and the core. However, whisper numbers are lower ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","Cryptocurrency,Economics,Markets,Trading Ideas,ETFs"

The results came amid an exciting earnings season. Here are some key analyst takeaways from the release.
JPMorgan On Broadcom
Analyst Harlan Sur maintained an Overweight rating while lifting the price target from $1,550 to $1,700.
Broadcom delivered better-than-expected quarterly results and reiterated its full-year outlook of $50 billion in revenues and 60% EBITDA margin, “on sustained momentum in semiconductors and solid growth in its mission critical software franchise,” Sur wrote in a note.
“For its semiconductor business, the team saw accelerating demand for its AI solutions ($2.3B in the Jan-Qtr, up 50%+ Q/Q) which offset weakness in its core diversified semi business (ex-AI ~$5.1B down 12% Q/Q,” Sur added.
Goldman Sachs On Broadcom
Analyst Toshiya Hari maintained a Buy rating while bumping the price target from $1,325 to $1,550.
Broadcom delivered “solid” results for the quarter, with non-GAAP earnings beating Street expectations by 6% “on strength in the AI semiconductor business and strong synergy capture immediately following the VMware acquisition,” Hari said.

A Murky Report
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows that in the big picture, the market has not moved much on the Jobs Report.
On a micro level, there was initially selling on the Jobs Report but the dip was aggressively bought running up the market.
The trendline on the chart shows that the stock market is beginning to break away to the upside from the trendline.
The chart shows that the stock market is comfortably above the support zone.
RSI on the chart shows that it is easier for the market to go higher than lower.
Jobs Report, also known as the mother of all reports, is murky giving ammunition to both stock market bulls and bears. Here are the details:

Non-farm payrolls came at 275K vs 195K consensus. This indicates that the job growth is a lot stronger than expected.
Nonfarm private payrolls came at 223K vs 150K consensus. This indicates that the job growth is strong in the private sector.
Unemployment rate came at 3.9% vs 3.7% consensus. This indicates that while the job growth is strong unemployment is rising.
Average hourly earnings came at 0.1% vs 0.3% consensus.  In The Arora Report analysis, this is the most important data point for investors. This data indicates that hourly wages are rising at the rate of 1.2% annualized. This is much lower than what workers would like but is great for the profits of corporations and also for curbing inflation. This data point is positive for the stock market.
Average work week came at 34.3 vs 34.3 consensus.


The forgoing data is such that the analysts can convincingly make a case for all three of the following depending on personal bias:

No landing

Addressing the Senate Banking Committee, Powell indicated that the Fed is not too far from being confident enough to cut rates suggesting a growing inclination among policymakers to initiate easing policy this year.
Powell’s statements injected fresh optimism into the markets, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 climbing to 18,290, nearing its previous record of 18,333 points achieved just days prior.

Stock Buying On Hopium
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL).
Note the following:

This article is about the big picture, not an individual stock. The chart of AAPL stock is being used to illustrate the point.
The chart shows AAPL stock has fallen to a critical level – the bottom band of the support/resistance zone.
The chart shows where the stops of less informed investors are.
If the stock market starts falling, Wall Street’s hunt and destroy algorithms will go into action and take out the stops of less informed investors.
On very long term good positions, such as AAPL, prudent investors should consider using hedges when appropriate. Hedging allows you to hold on to very long term positions.  
As a full disclosure, AAPL stock is in ZYX Buy Core Model Portfolio and is long from $4.68. Even after the drop in AAPL stock price, this represents a gain of 3548%.
The chart shows two Arora signals to hedge AAPL stock.
The chart shows that the hedges on AAPL are nicely profitable.
The chart shows RSI convergence – RSI foreshadowed AAPL stock drop.
RSI on the chart shows that AAPL stock is now oversold. Expect buying to come in on the slightest bit of good news.
The chart shows AAPL stock making lower highs. This is a technical negative.
In The Arora Report analysis, the divergence that is developing between AAPL and Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ: QQQ) is a yellow caution signal for investors.
Here is the key question for investors: Will the divergence be resolved by AAPL moving higher or QQQ moving lower.
Powell is giving testimony in front of Congress. Here are the key points Powell will say based on his prepared text:

Inflation has eased but remains above the 2% goal.
The policy rate is likely at its peak.
If the economy evolves as expected, it will be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some time this year.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) fails have been rare since the company introduced the iPhone in 2007, but the recent abandonment of its decade of research and investment in an autonomous car was a black-eye for the company.
Meanwhile, its latest launch, the Vision Pro, a “spatial computing” virtual reality and video headset, has met with mixed reviews and has a $3,499 starting price.
“With a dearth of impactful applications beyond watching movies, Vision Pro clearly needs vastly improved price/performance for bull arguments for disruptive upside opportunity to be credible,” said Rosenblatt analyst Barton Crockett.
What Apple needs, the analyst added, if it is to maintain its position alongside other Magnificent Seven stocks such as Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), is to step up its artificial intelligence offerings.

(NASDAQ:META).
He also believes Apple's AI play can move the earnings needle for Cupertino in double-digit percentages.
What Happened: Munster expressed optimism about Apple's AI play, stating that the company's first AI model is expected to be announced sometime in June.
However, investors in 2024 so far have not been very optimistic about Apple's prospects like analysts have.

However, Apple stock itself has not performed as well as it should have if AI is indeed a potential revenue maker for the company.
In fact, the Nasdaq Composite has beaten the Apple stock as far as performance in 2024 so far is concerned.

Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)
Overweight, PT $225, 27% Upside 
Amazon stands as a market leader in e-commerce and public cloud, positioned well for future growth.

But a trio of top Internet small and mid-cap (SMID) picks have over 50% upside potential. Here are the investment theses for each of these stocks.
1. Match Group Inc.
Carpenter rates Match (NASDAQ:MTCH) as ‘Overweight’ and sets a price target of $55, suggesting a noteworthy 53% upside. 
The rationale behind this optimistic outlook includes the anticipation of Tinder payers returning to growth. As the company shifts its focus from price optimizations to product and marketing, Carpenter expects positive trends with net add losses peaking in 4Q23 and turning positive in 3Q24. 
The growth of Hinge, recent product launches, and an undemanding valuation further contribute to Match’s appeal.
MTCH Price Action: Match stock was trading at $35.20 at the time of publication.

What Happened: Niles believes that the earnings potential of these companies will drive their stock performance in 2024, reported CNBC on Sunday. Niles pointed out that the recent surge in stock prices for big tech firms was not due to their earnings but rather the Federal Reserve’s policies.
He anticipates a shift this year, where earnings will play a more significant role in stock market performance. Despite negative estimate revisions for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Niles’ four picks continue to see analysts raise forecasts.
Analysts have raised EPS expectations for the four stocks by an average of 50% since the end of last year. In contrast, estimates have remained nearly flat for Google, Tesla, and Apple. This trend has resulted in substantial stock price increases for Nvidia, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon.

According to Peter Callahan, a sector specialist at Goldman Sachs Global Banking & Markets, it’s not just a fleeting phenomenon but is rooted in sustainable and enduring fundamentals.

The S&P 500 Index is up over 25% in the past year. 
This is evident by the price appreciation seen in ETFs tracking it — the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPY), the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:VOO) and the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:IVV).
At the forefront of this surge are the Magnificent Seven tech stocks. These have played a pivotal role in driving the S&P 500’s recent rally.

Despite the sharper-than-expected contraction revealed by the ISM Manufacturing PMI in February – with the overall index plummeting from 49.5 to 47.8, missing the anticipated 49.1 – investors remained upbeat. The data triggered downward pressure on the dollar and Treasury yields, maintaining firm expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts.
Fed speakers – including Goolsbee, Waller and Bostic – offered a mixed bag of remarks, though collectively acknowledging the ongoing progress toward disinflation. Additionally, a Fed report highlighted that inflation expectations broadly align with the 2% target.
In the tech sector, the semiconductor industry continued its remarkable performance, buoyed by escalating demand for chips associated with artificial intelligence. The industry benchmark, as monitored by the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX), surged 3.7% following a 2.7% leap on Thursday, marking its highest level since inception.

Inflation Gauge
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows that the stock market has failed to make progress since the release of hotter CPI.
The chart shows that the stock market was pulling back before the release of PCE, but improved on release of PCE.
The stock market has been anxiously awaiting PCE. PCE is the Fed’s favorite inflation gauge. PCE rose the most in a year. Here are the details:

Headline PCE came at 0.3% vs. 0.4% consensus.
Core PCE came at 0.4% vs. 0.4% consensus.


In The Arora Report analysis, the stock market improved on the release of the PCE data as there was fear of an even worse number.
Digging into the data that underlies PCE, in The Arora Report analysis, there is deflation in goods, but there is serious inflation in services. Deflation in goods is coming from China.
The release of PCE data has triggered aggressive buying in AI stocks and bitcoin. The buying is especially aggressive in C3.ai Inc (NYSE: AI) after the release of PCE data. C3.ai released better than expected earnings after the close yesterday. As a full disclosure, a signal was given in The Arora Report's ZYX Buy Change Alert.
The release of PCE data is also leading to very aggressive buying in small caps. As a full disclosure, iShares Russell 2000 ETF (ARCA: IWM) and its buy zone are in The Arora Report's ZYX Allocation Core Model Portfolio.
Personal income and spending data was also released this morning. Here are the details:

Personal spending came at 0.2% vs. 0.2% consensus.
Personal income came at 1.0% vs. 0.5% consensus.


Weekly initial claims came at 215K vs. 206K consensus. This indicates that the jobs picture remains strong, especially at the low end. However, the jobs picture is getting weaker in IT as many jobs are being replaced by AI.
Yesterday, the Fed’s Williams, Collins, and Bostic said that the Fed will continue to be date dependent. Bostic ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","Economics,Markets,General"

Biotech Breakout
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (ARCA: XBI).
Note the following:

The chart shows biotech has broken out.
The chart shows the move up was on high volume, indicating conviction in the move.
The chart shows when XBI was in the Arora buy zone. This represents a 54% gain in about four months. XBI is in the ZYX Allocation Core Model Portfolio by The Arora Report.
RSI on the chart shows that biotech is overbought.
The breakout in biotech shows there are opportunities for investors beyond AI, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA), and big tech.
Eli Lilly And Co (NYSE: LLY) is a prime example. LLY has gained 139% in about a year.
In important news for AI, Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) has canceled its electric vehicle project.  About 2,000 people have been working on this project. Apple seems to be recognizing that it needs to devote more resources to AI. This is good news for Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA).
Just released GDP data shows the economy is very strong and there is inflation pressure. Here are the details:

Q4 GDP Second Estimate came at 3.2% vs. 3.2% consensus.
GDP Deflator Second Estimate came at 1.6% vs. 1.5% consensus.


Prudent investors should keep in mind that GDP is a lagging indicator. The Arora Report system is based on leading indicators in ten categories. Please click here to see the ten categories of the ZYX Asset Allocation Model.

Until around a month ago, you could still take odds at around 3/1 that the first cut would come in March. Now almost certainly off the table, May or June come into focus for the first downward move.

And what if between now and then, the inflation data begin to show further stickiness. There are plenty of outliers that haven’t yet been seen in the official data.
Supply Chain And Wage Growth Risks
Outliers such as the impact of longer lead times and higher shipping costs on goods and raw materials because of longer shipping routes as freight avoids the Red Sea.
“Red Sea tensions have started to impact freight costs, which could lead to more general supply-chain pressures that were a major cause of the inflation surge in 2022,” said Jeremy De Pessemier, strategist at the World Gold Council.

In an exclusive interview with Benzinga, Dave Mazza, chief strategy officer at Roundhill Investments, shared insights on the company’s strategic approach, which has led to robust performance and rising investor inflows.
Recently, the two funds have garnered the highest inflows within Roundhill’s ETF suite.
In just the last month, Mazza said the two ETFs have drawn close to $100 million in fresh investments.
Roundhill’s focus on innovation has been instrumental, the chief strategy officer said.

Boom/Bust: Nvidia’s “quarter/guidance for the ages” delivered this week should not unduly worry investors, according to analyst Daniel Ives. For those doubters, the analyst has a definitive response. “Our answer is firm and confident: this is a 1995 Moment as now the AI Revolution and $1 trillion of incremental spending over the next decade is hitting the software ecosystem and rest of tech sector,” he said.
“Nvidia and the golden GPUs are the start of the spending wave…not the end.” 
The AI revolution will only intensify further, as a myriad of use cases are built out across the enterprise and consumer ecosystem, Ives said, adding that this is a “transformational tech trend” not seen since the start of the Internet in the mid 1990s.

As a provider of key technology needed to develop artificial intelligence (AI) platforms, the company is strategically positioned to benefit from the ongoing AI craze. 
Jensen Huang, Nvidia's co-founder and chief executive, said during the late Wednesday call that ""a whole new industry is being formed, and that's driving our growth."" 
Investors took these words seriously, taking much of the tech sector up.
While big tech companies like Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) compete to find the next groundbreaking stage in AI, companies that provide the infrastructure for those developments are the beneficiaries.
With quarterly revenues of $22.10 billion representing an increase of 265% year-over-year, Nvidia's growth was fueled by rising sales of AI infrastructure such as the H200 chip.
Analysts looking at Nvidia's performance overwhelmingly made mention of the growing market for generative AI as a motor behind the company's recent success, with several analysts raising the company's price target.
Nvidia's success in AI is pushing it close to the 2 trillion market cap, making it the third largest company by that measure. The company's $240 billion jump in market capitalization on Thursday accounts as the largest single-day jump in market history.

Tepid Consumer
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT).
Note the following:

The Morning Capsule is about the big picture, not an individual stock. The chart of WMT stock is being used to illustrate the point.
The U.S. economy is 70% consumer based, and Walmart is the largest retailer in the U.S. Therefore, investors should pay close attention to Walmart.
The chart shows the stock is going higher as of this writing.
The chart shows when Walmart reported earnings. Walmart beat earnings estimates for the last quarter. Here are the details:

Q4 revenue came at $173.4B vs. $158.4B consensus.
Walmart hit $100B in e-commerce sales.
Q1 adjusted EPS came at $1.48-$1.56 vs. $1.48 consensus.
Dividend increased by 9%.


The stock market has held up, in part, due to excess consumer spending.
Stock market bulls are counting on excess consumer spending continuing.
Walmart earnings are painting a tepid picture of the consumer. Walmart says shoppers are staying “choiceful.” The data from Walmart runs counter to stock market bulls’ hopium of the consumer continuing to spend excessively.
Walmart stock is running up, in part, because Walmart is buying Vizio Holding Corp (NYSE: VZIO) to expand advertising. VZIO is in the ZYX Buy portfolio that surrounds the Model Portfolio, and VZIO is the 191st Arora Portfolio company to be bought out.  
As we have stated before, the most critical item for the stock market is NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA) earnings. For details, please see ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","Cryptocurrency,Economics,Markets,General"

What Happened: Wedbush CEO Dan Ives expressed that investors are increasingly becoming frustrated with Snap, reported The Times on Sunday.
""Every quarter, there is another ‘dog ate the homework' excuse,"" said Ives.
""A lot of investors have become so frustrated, they will never touch it again.""
According to Benzinga Pro data, Snap closed at $11.17 on Friday, much lower than the $17 IPO price.

Hartnett’s insights reveal that while every bubble is unique, they share common catalysts such as technological innovation, new markets and, notably, central bank easing. These elements have historically converged to inflate asset prices beyond sustainable levels.
The AI bubble, for example, was ignited by the Federal Reserve’s response to Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse and the subsequent rise of ChatGPT. This scenario mirrors past bubbles such as the Plaza Accord’s effect on Japan and the internet bubble fueled by the Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) crisis. 
Similarly, policy stimuli in response to the COVID-19 pandemic inflated crypto and tech stocks, reminiscent of the Mississippi and South Sea Company bubbles sparked by changes to English usury laws in 1714.

UBER is a prime example and a key reminder to investors that there are opportunities beyond the magnificent seven and AI. While the magnificent seven stocks and AI have been driving the stock market, there are opportunities for investors in less expensive stocks with better potential for risk adjusted returns. The magnificent seven stocks are Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc.

The firm’s decision to increase its holdings in Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and META Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), while reducing its stake in Coinbase Global Inc (NASDAQ:COIN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), signals a calculated response to recent developments and future growth prospects.
The Tesla Trade
Ark Invest’s acquisition of 145,455 Tesla shares, valued at $27.45 million, underscores Cathie Wood’s confidence in the electric vehicle giant amidst market fluctuations. The transactions were made through ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK), ARK Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF (BATS:ARKQ), and ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSE:ARKW). On Wednesday, Tesla shares closed 2.55% higher at $188.71.
This move aligns with Wood’s optimistic view on Tesla’s growth trajectory, further emphasized by the firm’s continued investment despite Tesla’s fourth-quarter earnings miss and the surrounding discussions on Tesla’s recovery and Elon Musk’s compensation controversy.
The Coinbase Trade
Coinbase shares worth $34.33 million were purchased by Ark on Wednesday. The 214,068 shares were purchased through ARKK, ARKF, and ARKW. On the day, Coinbase shares rallied 14.2% at $160.38.

The analyst noted the company needs a +$1.58 beat on the fourth quarter and estimated fiscal 2025 revenue of $99 billion. The chip designer reports earnings on February 21. 
Rolland expects better results and guidance as checks around Data Center GPUs are solid. 
For Data Center (now >80% of revenue), Al demand remains strong, helped by better hyper-scale capex guidance and recent commentary from Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) suggesting continued vital GPU purchases.

The broader Seattle area, encompassing Tacoma and Bellevue, was not spared, witnessing a nearly 93% fall in sales volume from $3.8 billion to $283.4 million.
Driving Forces Behind The Drop
This sharp decline in office property transactions can be attributed to several factors, including significant job losses in the tech sector, which is a major economic driver in the region. 
As the data showed, the Seattle area saw the tech industry shed 44,700 jobs last year, a trend expected to persist and further reduce demand for office space. Additionally, the increasing adoption of hybrid working models has negatively impacted the need for traditional office environments.

Hotter Inflation
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows a slight pullback on inflation data.
The chart shows volume continues to be low, indicating lack of conviction.
The volume today will be a tell. If the stock market pulls back on heavy volume on bad inflation data, that will be an indication that the bulls are losing control. On the other hand, if the stock market has only a shallow pullback or goes up on lower volume, that will be an indication that bulls continue to be in control.
CPI was worse than expected. Here are the details:

Headline CPI came at 0.3% month-over-month vs. 0.2% consensus.
Core CPI came at 0.4% month-over-month vs. 0.3% consensus.


In yesterday’s Morning Capsule, we shared with you:

Momo gurus are already being proactive to prevent a selloff if the data shows that inflation is not coming down. The new mantra of momo gurus is that stocks will go up even if inflation does not come down. Keep in mind that momo gurus’ real job is to run up the stock market under the disguise of analysis.


Momo gurus are extremely clever. Realizing that their new narrative was not that good, now they have come up with a more persuasive narrative to persuade their followers to buy stocks. The new narrative is that this rise in inflation is a one-off.
The CPI data today shows that Powell’s fear of Burns’ blunder is justified. Arthur Burns was the most intelligent Fed Chairman. He lowered rates when inflation came down but was forced to raise rates again when inflation picked up again. This is known as Burns’ blunder.
New earnings are having an impact on the stock market.

“Expectations for strong macro and no recession keep investors in the soft landing camp at 65%, with hard landing probability fading to just 11%,” said lead analyst Michael Hartnett, noting also that those managers now expecting “no landing,” or continued growth trajectory, rose to 19% in February, up from 7% in January.

Johnson noted three technical indicators, including a decline in the number of industry groups that were above their 40-week average, while the number of new highs among these groups peaked at the end of 2023.
“All of this happened as the market was working its way higher, so this market is really going up on bad breath,” he said.
“So, we’re saying: ‘You don’t have to let go, but hold on loosely.’ Be ready for a correction in this market that could probably take the S&P 500 back to about 4,600,” Johnson said, adding that the low is likely to come towards the end ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","Mid Cap,Sector ETFs,News,Equities,Large Cap,Health Care,Small Cap,Top Stories,Economics,Federal Reserve,Exclusives,Markets,Tech,ETFs,General"

Small Caps
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of small cap iShares Russell 2000 ETF (ARCA: IWM).
Note the following:

The chart shows the 2021 high in small caps.
The chart shows the high in small caps in 2023.
The chart shows small caps are still well below the 2021 high.
Small caps staged a big rally in 2023, but small caps have not rocketed to new highs like the S&P 500. This may be an opportunity for investors. Here is what investors should keep in mind:

IWM could be a catch up trade.
On the other hand, small caps should have performed better than they have.The difference could be explained due to the lack of high flying AI stocks in IWM, or the difference could be a warning.
Small caps are interest rate sensitive and should do well when the Fed cuts rates.
Small caps are economically sensitive. As such, small caps should do well if there is no landing.
IWM includes many banks. If there is no banking crisis, IWM should do well.
If the overall stock market maintains its gains, small caps provide an opportunity to investors.


Fed speak is ahead. The Fed’s Michelle Bowman, Tom Barkin, and Neel Kashkari will be speaking today.
Consumer Price Index (CPI) will be released Tuesday at 8:30am ET. The stock market is assuming that inflation will continue to go down. If CPI shows that inflation is continuing to come down, S&P 500 will rally. On the other hand, if CPI is stronger than expected, there is a lot of air in the stock market and as such may lead to a rapid pullback.

Momo gurus are already being proactive to prevent a selloff if the data shows that inflation is not coming down. The new ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","News,Small Cap,Economics,Markets,Trading Ideas"

These two stocks were among the best performers of 2023 — indeed, Nvidia was the year’s winner by a country mile with a gain of 239% — and also led the powerful fourth-quarter surge that has resumed in the opening weeks of 2024.
Much of this momentum is based on the anticipation that AI will become a significant revenue stream, despite it not yet making a substantial impact on the earnings of either company.
Some fear that these AI expectations have become overplayed and the risk of disappointment could burst this AI “baby bubble”, as analysts at Bank of America call it.

Revised CPI

Note the following:

The chart shows the revised CPI data brought in buyers to the stock market.
The chart shows that volume continues to be low. This indicates that so far there is lack of conviction in the move. However, this can change very quickly.
The stock market has been eagerly waiting for CPI revisions as there have been times in the past when such revisions caused major moves in the stock market.
A year ago, when inflation appeared to be coming down, revisions completely changed the picture.
As of this writing, the complete data is not yet available. Here are the details known so far:

Q4 Core CPI is unchanged at 3.3% annualized.
December CPI revised to 0.2% from 0.3%.
December Core CPI is unchanged at 0.3%.


Bond yields are slightly lower after the CPI revisions.
The sum total of the revision data so far is positive for the stock market.
As more data becomes available, it may move the stock market. CPI for January will be released next Tuesday at 8:30am ET.
Adding to the AI frenzy is the news that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wants to raise $5T - $7T for manufacturing AI chips. He appears to be trying to raise the money from oil rich nations.

What Happened: On Thursday, Cramer acknowledged the significant influence of megacap tech companies, including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), on the market but also pointed out other stocks that could offer substantial returns, reported CNBC.

Musk responded by suspending Sweeney’s Twitter account, saying that doxxing real-time locations was prohibited.
But, Sweeney continued posting Musk’s private flight information on other social media sites like Instagram and Threads. Sweeney, who uses public information and an automated system to run his flight-tracking posts, also has accounts tracking the private jet usage of celebrities like Kim Kardashian, Donald Trump and Taylor Swift. 
Basically: Like Musk, Swift’s team appeared not to be thrilled with Sweeney’s flight-tracking hobby. The pop star’s team sent Sweeney a letter threatening legal action if he continued posting her flight data, Sweeney told Benzinga in an email this week. 
The letter was sent in December, according to The Washington Post.

S&P 500 At 5000
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows that S&P 500 is comfortably above the top band of the support zone.  
The chart shows that the move up is on lower volume. This is a negative. 
Historically, when S&P 500 hits the next 1000 benchmark, the median return is as follows:

0.57% after one week
2.00% after one month
3.5% after three months
7.73% after six months


The above data is only history, and no one should depend on it. It is more important to understand how various groups behave.  

Sentiment moves higher in the extreme zone.
Momo crowd buying becomes even more aggressive.
Mom and pop who are normally not active in the stock market jump in.
Bears throw in the towel and jump in.
Underperforming money managers become aggressive buyers.
Smart money takes advantage of the strength and trims positions. 


“Buy low and sell high” is a simple concept in theory. This is exactly what you need to do to consistently beat the stock market. However, in practice it is not as easy as it sounds for the following reasons:

Human emotions of fear and greed.
Market mechanics
Market controlled by momo crowd
Momo gurus
Short squeezes
Thousands of constantly changing variables from across the globe


The key is to look at returns, not only in terms of absolute returns, but in terms of risk adjusted returns.
As an actionable item, the sum total of the foregoing is in the protection band, which strikes the optimum balance between various crosscurrents. Please scroll down to see the protection band. 

Jobless Claims
Initial Jobless Claims came at 218K vs. 218K consensus. This indicates that the jobs picture is staying strong.  Initial Jobless Claims is a leading indicator and carries heavy weight in our adaptive ZYX Asset Allocation Model with inputs in ten categories.  In plain English, adaptiveness means that the model changes itself with market conditions. Most models on Wall Street are static. They work for a while and then stop working when market conditions change.

Here’s a look at how much return an investment in a basket comprising the Magnificent seven stocks in equal proportion would have fetched vis-a-vis Cathie Wood-led Ark Investment’s flagship Ark Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK).
New Group On The Block: FAANG was the precursor to the group, now collectively called the Magnificent Seven. Originally named FANG by Jim Cramer in 2013, the group became known as FAANG with the addition of Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in 2017. The original members were Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), which then went by the name Facebook, Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), formerly Google.
Later iterations were MAGA, which included Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) along with Apple, Alphabet and Amazon, and MAMAA, comprising Meta, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon.
The phrase Magnificent Seven was first used by BofA Securities analyst Michael Hartnett in 2023. The constituent companies spearheaded the stock market rebound during the year, thanks to the dominant market positioning, innovativeness, brand appeal and financial muscle of these companies. This group comprises the biggest mega-cap techs including Meta, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA).

What Happened: Brian Belski, the chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets, believes that the current market risk due to the dominance of mega-cap tech stocks is being overestimated. He stated in a note on Tuesday that the risk is not as severe as some might think, reported Business Insider.
The “Magnificent 7” mega-cap tech stocks, including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), currently account for 29% of the S&P 500.
Although a potential decline in demand for these stocks poses a risk, Belski is confident that the broader market can still yield positive returns even if the mega-cap tech stocks falter.
“Our work shows that the stock market has held up just fine in prior periods when the outperformance of mega-cap stocks started to wane,” Belski said.

Stronger-than-expected economic data — and comments from Federal Reserve officials indicating the central bank has no immediate plans to reduce rates — pushed major U.S. stock averages into the red.
Both Fed Chair Jerome Powell and Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari issued warnings that monetary policy may remain restrictive for a while due to the remarkable economic resilience.
In January, the services sector expanded beyond expectations, as indicated by the latest ISM PMI figures, marking the strongest growth since September 2023 and extending its 13th consecutive month of expansion.
Traders have now embraced the idea that a rate cut in March is off the table. Furthermore, they are reducing their rate cut expectations for 2024, going from six rate cuts last week to just about five as of Monday.

The long-running animated comedy “The Simpsons” may have predicted what happens when people wear virtual reality headsets at home and in public.
What Happened: Since the Vision Pro was released, images have gone viral of people wearing the headset on the street or the train. A driver of a Tesla vehicle was even pulled over wearing the Apple Vision Pro while driving.
While a world filled with people all wearing headsets in public could be years or decades away, ""The Simpsons"" may have predicted the disasters that could happen.
A clip from the 2016 episode titled ""Friends and Family"" went viral on X, formerly known as Twitter, over the weekend with more than eight million views. In the clip, residents of the fictional town of Springfield are seen wearing a virtual reality headset and subsequently running into light posts, falling down a manhole and laying in bed with a headset on next to a significant other also wearing a headset.
The clip features the Cream song ""I Feel Free"" playing in the background alluding to a world where headsets and virtual reality have taken over real-life interactions.

The chip designer will report its quarterly earnings after closing on February 21. 
The analyst will seek for a notable but more measured 3% – 5% or $0.5 billion – $1 billion upside to both the reported fourth quarter (consensus $20 billion) and guided first quarter (consensus $21.4 billion) mainly due to incremental supply gains offset by China restrictions and some transition effects before the B100 accelerator launch planned for the second half of 2024.

While a 3% – 5% beat would pale versus the 10% and 22% beat and raise of prior quarters and perhaps disappoint some bulls, the more measured pace will also be seen as creating more fertile ground for continued growth in the calendar year 2025 and beyond. 
Stepping above quarterly EPS noise, Arya will focus on Nvidia’s flagship GPU Tech Conference (GTC) planned for March 18 – March 20, where the company will likely showcase its pipeline and perhaps update the prior $250 billion annual AI accelerator TAM forecast.

Blowout Jobs Report And Earnings
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows a rally after a shallow pullback.
The chart shows that the shallow pullback approached but did not penetrate the high band of the support zone. From a technical perspective this is a positive.
The chart shows an attempt of a new breakout. This new breakout would have likely followed through if it was not for the jobs report data upsetting bulls’ hopium this morning.
The jobs report is a blowout. Here are the details:

Non-farm payrolls came at 353K vs. 175K consensus.
Non-farm private payrolls came at 317K vs. 150K consensus.
Unemployment rate came at 3.7% vs. 3.8% consensus.
Average work week came at 34.1 vs. 34.4 consensus.


This is the strongest jobs report since January 2023.
In The Arora Report analysis, this jobs report is simply too strong for the Fed to cut rates. Even though Powell was clear that a rate cut in March was not the base case, stock market bulls have continued to buy stocks on hopes of a rate cut in March.  
In The Arora Report analysis, this jobs report significantly upsets stock market bulls’ hopium. If it was not for the blowout earnings from Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: META), the stock market would have likely fallen by as much as 1000 DJIA points on this report.  Now the questions for prudent investors are the following:
In view of blowout earnings from AMZN and META, will the momo crowd even care about the jobs report?

Will the new narrative of momo gurus that interest rates no longer matter ring true with investors?  
Layoffs helped AMZN and META report blowout earnings. If the premarket gains hold, META and AMZN have added about $275B in market cap since they reported earnings after the close yesterday.  


META is initiating its first dividend and a $50B buyback. The addition of a dividend and the buyback to stellar earnings is resulting in META stock running up 17.15% since it reported earnings to the time of this writing. This ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","Economics,Federal Reserve,Markets,Trading Ideas"

Cues From Thursday's Trading:
Optimism preceding tech earnings and some favorable economic data contributed to gains across major averages on Thursday. The indices opened higher and remained range-bound in a sideways move until late-morning trading, with the Dow Industrials briefly dipping below the unchanged line. Subsequently, stocks initiated a rally and concluded near the session highs.
The majority of sectors displayed solid advancements during the session, illustrating the breadth of the rally, although energy stocks experienced some pullback.

What Happened: The Apple Vision Pro has been eagerly anticipated by Apple fans and augmented reality enthusiasts for years, and they will finally be able to get their hands on the headsets Friday with a starting price of $3,499.
""Vision Pro is a new kind of computer that augments reality, (it) will change the way we collaborate, work, enjoy entertainment,"" Cook said when unveiling the device.
Cook recalled his first experience with the Vision Pro six to eight years ago, before it had its current name, according to an interview with Vanity Fair.

Stock Market Direction
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows the stock market has pulled back on Powell’s remarks.
The chart shows the stock market is near the top band of the support zone.
The chart shows that in the early trade, the dip in the stock market is being bought.
The FOMC rate decision came as expected yesterday. However, Powell trampled on the speculation of a rate cut in March. Please read yesterday’s Afternoon Capsule for details.
Fed Chair Powell said labor availability is a big factor in the Fed’s decision.
Previously, the Fed was trying to drive unemployment higher. The reason was in traditional economics, higher unemployment brings down inflation.
This cycle has defied traditional economics thus far. Inflation is coming down while unemployment remains very low.
In The Arora Report analysis of Powell’s press conference, the Fed is not worried about inflation running back up. However, the Fed is concerned about inflation being sticky and staying above their target. If the employment picture stays strong, it will be difficult for the Fed to cut interest rates as the Fed does not want inflation to get stuck above their target. This is the reason prudent investors are paying very close attention to the jobs report.
The jobs report, known as the mother of all reports, will be released tomorrow at 8:30am ET.
In The Arora Report analysis, the jobs report tomorrow is the key to the near-term direction of the stock market. If the jobs report is strong, the stock market will likely tumble. If the jobs report is weak, the stock market will likely run up. 
Weekly initial jobless claims came at 224K vs. 215K consensus. This indicates that the jobs picture is still very strong, but the data is beginning to weaken.
Q4 Productivity-Prel came at 3.2% vs. 2.1% consensus.

(NASDAQ:META), Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Given the Federal Reserve’s data-dependent stance, a couple of manufacturing activity data and the routine jobless claims data due for the day could draw traders’ attention.
Cues From Wednesday's Trading:
U.S. stocks fell on Wednesday, stung by the double-whammy of earnings disappointments and a hawkish Fed. Traders reacted negatively to earnings from Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), all of which have significant weightings in the S&P 500 Index.
The major indices started the session lower and moved roughly sideways until the Fed decision. The Dow was seen moving in and out of the unchanged line as it received support from a strong upward move in Boeing Co.’s (NYSE:BA) shares. The Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 indices languished in negative territory.
Following the rate decision, the indices either moved above the flat line or trimmed their losses. Jerome Powell disappointed traders by offering no clear signal toward a rate-cut schedule, so they dumped stocks in late afternoon trading.
The S&P 500 Index pulled further away from its record close, with the broader gauge and the Nasdaq Composite settling at the lowest levels in about two weeks. 
The market witnessed a broad-based sell-off, with communications stocks being the worst hit. IT, consumer discretionary, and energy stocks also saw marked weakness.

The team’s recent findings indicate a concerning concentration of market power in the hands of the top 10 stocks on the MSCI USA Index, reminiscent of the worrisome market conditions seen two decades ago.
As Bloomberg reported Tuesday, the combined share of the MSCI USA Index’s top 10 stocks, including the prominent ‘Magnificent Seven’ technology giants, has escalated to a significant 29.3% in December. This figure approaches the historical peak of 33.2% witnessed in June 2000, during the height of the dot-com bubble.
Diversity within these top ranks is also dwindling, with only four sectors represented, a stark contrast to the historical median of six. This lack of diversification heightens the vulnerability of the market to shocks in these sectors.

What Happened: Wolfenbarger, a seasoned market observer, anticipates a severe drop in the U.S. stock market and a prolonged recession. Wolfenbarger, with over three decades of investing experience, relies on a variety of economic indicators that suggest an impending downturn, according to a Business Insider report Tuesday.
Wolfenbarger, the founder of Bull and Bear Profits and a former JPMorgan banker, is particularly concerned about the consistent decline of The Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index and the longest stretch of an inverted yield curve in more than half a century. His forecast is more severe than The Conference Board’s, which predicts a two-quarter recession.
“The depth of the latest yield curve inversion has only been matched or exceeded by those preceding the Great Depression and the major recessions of the mid-1970s and early 1980s,” said Wolfenbarger.

Despite this optimism, investors may exercise caution leading up to a two-day Federal Reserve meeting beginning on Tuesday. While economists expect the Fed to maintain the current high rate, traders will be attentive to signals regarding the trajectory of interest rates. Meanwhile, the Chinese market continues to experience volatility, driven by concerns about its troubled property sector.
Cues From Last Week’s Trading:
In the week ending on Jan. 26, major stock indices saw gains for a third consecutive week, buoyed by optimism surrounding the economy, inflation, and earnings. Key drivers included preliminary fourth-quarter GDP data highlighting the economy’s strength, varied earnings reports, and the December personal consumption expenditure index, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure.
The S&P 500 Index reached record levels for four sessions during the week, concluding just below the record, while the Dow Industrials closed the week in record territory.

He pointed out several instances where the market has defied conventional wisdom, potentially offering lucrative opportunities.
What Happened: Cramer, on Wednesday, highlighted the unusual market behavior over the past two years, advising investors to adapt their strategies accordingly, reported CNBC.
""Nothing we've ever learned about the market has played out like it was supposed to for the last two years,"" he said. 
""If we don't accept what's happened here, then I think we'll miss out on a lot of easily gettable wins, just like last year. When the market no longer reflects the playbook, you've got to throw out the playbook and write a new one.""
He cited the performance of homebuilders like Lennar Corp (NYSE:LEN), Toll Brothers Inc (NYSE:TOL), and PulteGroup Inc (NYSE:PHM), which have seen significant gains despite the Federal Reserve’s aggressive rate hikes.
Another example was Boeing Co (NYSE:BA), which saw its stock recover despite facing intense scrutiny following an incident with its 737 Max 9 aircraft.

With semiconductor units down 20% year-on-year in 2023, he noted that the worst unit correction in 22 years is almost through the inventory correction. 
While Danely expects more estimate cuts to the analog companies due to the auto and industrial correction (combined 30% of semi-TAM), the analyst noted these cuts are getting smaller, and should trough in the first half of fiscal 2024.
Danely is most positive on DRAM and reiterated Micron Technology, Inc (NASDAQ:MU) as his top pick, given his expected 50% year-on-year increase in DRAM pricing in 2024. 
Danely’s other Buy-rated names include Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), Microchip Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MCHP), AVGO, Analog Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:ADI), ON Semiconductor Corp (NASDAQ:ON), Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM), and GlobalFoundries Inc (NASDAQ:GFS).
Micron’s price target of $95 reflects DRAM upturn. AMD’s price target of $136 builds on PC recovery, server share gains and AI success. 
Broadcom’s price target of $1,100 took into account the company being an AI beneficiary, EPS accretion from VMWare. 
Microchip’s $100 price target builds upon bottoming of consensus EPS estimates. Qualcomm’s $160 price target attracted attention courtesy of wireless inventory replenishment and share gains at Samsung. 
Analog Devices’ price target of $210 gained attention as one of the most defensive name with bottoming consensus EPS estimates. On Semiconductor’s $85 price target reflected silicon carbide offsetting some of the downturn. GlobalFoundries’ $70 price target got a callout for restructuring initiatives offsetting semiconductor downturn.

Last Thursday, the company estimated that second-quarter net sales would be between $3.6 billion and $3.65 billion, versus the prior guidance of between $2.7 billion and $2.9 billion.
The adjusted diluted net income per common share will likely be between $5.40 and $5.55, versus the previous forecast of $4.40 to $4.88.
However, Wedbush analyst Matt Bryson said the company provided minimal color on the release, only signaling strong market demand for its products as driving the top-line upside.

What Happened: Richard Bernstein Advisors (RBA) has been signaling a potential investment opportunity amidst concerning signs in the stock market, reported Business Insider. The firm has been predicting a “once-in-a-generation” opportunity for months, and it appears to be on the verge of realization.
According to RBA’s Deputy CIO Dan Suzuki, the market’s current situation, particularly the dominance of a few stocks, could lead to a broader market shift. The firm’s thesis, proposed at the end of last year, suggests that the extraordinary market leadership of a small group of stocks will expand to the wider market, resulting in stronger gains for the other 493 S&P 500 stocks.
However, Suzuki warned that the corporate earnings of major tech companies are expected to decelerate in the next quarter.

The analysts included Baird’s Colin Sebastian, JMP’s Andrew Boone, Truist’s Youssef Squali, and KeyBanc’s Justin Patterson.
Patterson highlighted that CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s comments reinforced that Meta is hyper-focused on AI and has been investing considerably behind this effort (Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA) H100 GPUs alone represent a ~$9 billion investment). 
In contrast to industry feedback from Meta’s metaverse strategy in 2021, he was encouraged by how the AI community has supported Meta. 
Patterson expects AI to play a key part in Meta’s fourth-quarter earnings call (February 1, after market close) and will look for more updates on how Zuckerberg thinks about AI investments and products (both in Meta’s Family of Apps and in computing devices).

Encouragement is also drawn from Congress’s agreement on a bill to fund the federal government until early March. Additionally, the day’s trading direction may be influenced by a few Federal Reserve official speeches, a consumer sentiment reading, and regional bank earnings.
As sentiment takes a positive turn, the focus shifts to the S&P 500 Index, with anticipation of surpassing its previous all-time high of 4,796.56 set in early January 2022.
Cues From Thursday's Trading:

Tech optimism fueled a market rebound on Thursday following positive fourth-quarter earnings from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM). Further strength was added by Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic’s comments hinting at a potential rate cut in the third quarter.
The major averages opened higher but followed divergent paths, with the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 maintaining gains throughout the session. The Dow Industrials initially stayed mostly in the red before moving into positive territory late in the afternoon, breaking a three-session losing streak.
The Nasdaq 100 Index, consisting of the 100 largest non-financial tech stocks, closed Thursday’s session at a new record.
Economic readings revealed a surprise drop in jobless claims for the week ended Jan. 13, a larger-than-expected contraction in Philadelphia region manufacturing activity, and a mixed housing starts report.
S&P 500 rally leaders included IT, communication services, industrial, and IT services stocks, while defensive utility and real estate stocks ended the session lower.

The analyst noted that the setup is constructive, with three catalysts ahead. 
First, FY24 consensus revenue growth of 13% appears conservative against his expected 22% exit rate, considering drivers including improved monetization in Reels and FB Shops and increased demand from Chinese e-commerce advertisers. 
Lee's checks show that advertising recovered quickly from geopolitical uncertainties in early October. 
Furthermore, there was surprising strength in holiday shopping, share gains of Chinese advertisers such as Shein and Temu, and the success of Shop Ads with its notable partnership with Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN).

What Happened: Peter Oppenheimer, a Goldman Sachs analyst, conveyed this prediction during his appearance on CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe,” reported Business Insider.
The current economic super cycle, characterized by a rapid expansion period, originated in the 1980s, according to Oppenheimer. This period of substantial growth was ignited when borrowing costs peaked, followed by nearly 35 years of low interest rates, deregulation of several industries, and globalization.

The forthcoming super cycle, however, won’t rely on the same elements. Interest rates, for example, are not in a steep decline, and globalization is under scrutiny. Nevertheless, Oppenheimer sees potential in new drivers, such as the increasing influence of AI on productivity and initiatives towards decarbonization.
Last year, the AI surge propelled tech companies to dominate the market, with firms like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Meta (NASDAQ:META) experiencing three-figure gains in their stock prices.

Wall Street is facing its first weekly loss after nine-straight gains, leaving traders anxiously speculating about the future – whether this signals further losses or a resurgence of the rally.
Traditionally, the “Santa Rally” often extends into January, typically a favorable month for stocks. Although we’re just a week into the month, so there’s still potential for a positive outcome. Let’s explore some key themes that could help settle some nerves.
VIX Index Still Historically Low
While the VIX Volatility Index, often referred to as the “Wall Street fear gauge,” experienced a slight increase over the week, it fell on Friday and continues to stay well under the 20 mark — a threshold commonly viewed by traders as indicative of heightened fear.
Thus, traders are not running headlong for the doors. Traditional safety measures such as reallocation to bonds and gold were not significant.

However, Marc Chaikin, founder and CEO of Chaikin Analytics, believes that this does not signify an end to the rally that began in late October.
During his appearance on Benzinga PreMarket Prep, Chaikin highlighted his perspective, especially for the 493 stocks in the S&P 500 that fall outside the realm of the so-called Magnificent Seven tech giants. He pointed out that this period could be particularly significant for these stocks, suggesting potential opportunities outside the tech sector.
Despite a small gain during Thursday morning, the broad market index remains 1.1% lower since 2024 trading began on Tuesday. The exchange traded fund that tracks the index, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPY) is down by the same amount.
Chaikin puts this in context by explaining that on Tuesday, when the S&P 500 fell by 1%, there were more stocks that gained than stocks that lost. Because of the huge weighting of the Mag7 — Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), Nvidia Inc (NASDAQ:NVDA) et al — the market was lower.

New Economic Data
Please click here for a chart of Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ: QQQ).
Note the following:

The chart shows tech stocks have fallen back into the support zone.
RSI on the chart shows tech stocks are near oversold.
The stock market has a consensus now that everything is going to be immaculate – the landing, the Fed, interest rates, earnings, adoption of AI, Russia, China, and the Middle East.
The stock market is assuming a 90% probability of seven rate cuts.
The stock market is going to face new economic data today:

ISM Manufacturing Index will be released at 10am ET. The consensus is 47.1%.
JOLTS report will be released at 10am ET.


The stock market will also face minutes from the last FOMC meeting at 2pm ET. Powell was dovish in the press conference, flipping 180 degrees. At The Arora Report, we will be reading the Fed minutes to see if the 180 degree flip was unanimous or if there was dissension.
If the new data and the Fed minutes are supportive of immaculate everything, expect a rip roaring rally and new highs.
If the data is not supportive of immaculate everything, expect momo gurus to come up with a new narrative to try to run up the stock market.
Market mechanics are neutral as of this writing in the premarket but can easily swing in either direction after the data and Fed minutes.
Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin has made two key points this morning:

Rate hikes are not off the table.
The soft landing is at risk.


As an actionable item, the sum total of the foregoing is in the protection band, which strikes the optimum balance between various crosscurrents. Please scroll down to see the protection band.

What Happened: Cramer on Tuesday predicted that investors might move away from the leading Magnificent Seven tech stocks to invest in sectors that have experienced significant declines, like the food and pharmaceutical industries, reported CNBC.
Cramer stated, “My crystal ball suggests that profits will be taken from the best of the best, including the Magnificent Seven and friends, as well as the richly valued software enterprise names. I think investors will use that cash to invest in companies that haven’t gotten any respect for ages.”

Cramer warned that this shift might be temporary, with investors potentially returning to their December favorites once earnings reports are released.

Shares of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) experienced the sharpest sell-off — over 4%. The Cupertino, California-based company shed $116 billion in market cap in a single session. 
This plunge, the most severe since early August 2023, was triggered by a sell call from a Barclays analyst, Tim Long, who downgraded the iPhone maker from Equalweight to Underweight, while also lowering the price target from $161 to $160.

Opportunities Ahead But Be Astute
Please click here for a chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

Plenty of opportunities are ahead in 2024, but you need to be astute as to when to buy, what to buy, and how to buy if you want market beating returns.  
The chart shows that during the Santa Claus rally, the stock market did not hit the top band of the resistance zone. In the very short term, this is a negative.
The chart shows the stock market has pulled back to the low band of the resistance zone. To maintain bullish posture, the stock market needs to not go much below the bottom band of the resistance zone.
There are likely many stops right below the bottom band of the resistance zone.  If the stock market starts dropping, hunt and destroy algorithms will go into action and take out the stops. This is the reason that The Arora Report recommends not placing stops at obvious points.
Historically, after the stops are taken out, there is a bounce. Officially, the period for the Santa Claus rally will end at the close tomorrow.
RSI shown on the chart is on a sell signal, but the pattern is such that it can quickly reverse to a buy signal.
RSI on the chart shows negative divergence. In plain English, this means that RSI and the price are moving differently. This is a negative in the very short term.
In the early trade this morning, there is considerable tax related selling. Historically, such selling is common after a strong year. The reason is that investors did not want to sell in 2023 to avoid paying capital gains taxes for the 2023 tax year.  By selling now, they have successfully postponed paying capital gains tax by one year.
As the year starts, investors are again making the classic mistake that we warned you about late last year. The classic mistake investors make at this time of the year is to act on the following:

2024 year end targets from Wall Street strategists
Sector recommendations from Wall Street strategists


In our 40 years in the markets, a vast majority of the time, Wall Street strategists are wrong. To understand the recent history, consider the following:

Right now, investors are worshiping permabulls and deriding permabears.
In 2023 at the start of the new year, investors were worshiping permabears and deriding permabulls. What did the stock market do? The stock market went up.
In 2022 at the start of the new year, investors were worshiping permabulls and deriding permabears. What did the stock market do? The stock market went down.

What Happened: Rogers, who co-founded the Quantum Fund and Soros Fund Management with George Soros, sees bubbles in bonds, property, and stocks. He has offloaded a significant portion of his stocks and bonds in anticipation of a steep downturn, reported Business Insider.
“Bonds are a bubble, property in many countries is a bubble, stocks are getting ready for a bubble,” the veteran investor and travel author said in an interview with Soar Financially.





Rogers pointed out “warning signs” of an impending collapse, including a small group of stocks driving the major indices higher and novice investors bragging about their easy wins in the market.

Nice Profits On Tactical Positions
Please click here for a chart of S&P 500 ETF (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows the market is in the resistance zone.
RSI on the chart shows that the market is neither overbought nor oversold.
The chart shows the Santa Claus rally is in full swing.
Sentiment is extremely positive. Prudent investors should take note, this is a contrary indicator. We previously wrote:

As we have been sharing with you, at extremely positive, sentiment is a contrary indicator. In plain English, sentiment at extremely positive is a sell signal. Here are the key points:


No one should act based only on sentiment.



Sentiment is an important indicator but only one of the many indicators that go into a comprehensive 360 degree analysis.



Sentiment is not a precise timing indicator.



If the stock market pulls back, sentiment may also pull back, and thus negate any negative implications.



 Market mechanics continue to be on the positive side.



When the calendar changes to the new year, the stock market can abruptly change.  We previously shared with you:

In The Arora Report analysis, the start of the new year will likely be the same as every other new year after a strong year for the stock market — if the stock market starts going down, everyone will jump on the selling bandwagon; if the stock market starts going up, everyone will buy.


There are nice profits on tactical positions. It is prudent before the year end to take partial profits on tactical positions or raise hedges or a combination of the two.  
Consider continuing to hold strategic positions.

Deflation: This will be a key theme in 2024, prompting the Federal Reserve to cut rates aggressively. This economic environment, combined with technological progress, sets up firms that are well-adapted to deflation and dedicated to innovation for significant expansion in the upcoming years.

Wood attributed this success to concentrating on high-conviction stocks during the downturn, a move considered risky by many.

Market Mechanics Surprise
Please click here for a chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows a sell-off yesterday.
The chart shows the sell-off brought the stock market below the low band of the resistance zone.
The chart shows that this morning the stock market is rallying again in the early trade and is back to the low band of the resistance zone.
The chart shows that RSI was very overbought, and thus the stock market was vulnerable to a sell-off when a surprise occurred in market mechanics.
As we have been sharing with you, several market mechanics have been driving the stock market up. One of those market mechanics is 0DTE options. Everyday traders have been aggressively buying 0DTE calls. Everyday when the market started going up, market makers were forced to buy stocks to hedge the calls they had sold.
During the rally, market makers were more than happy to sell puts to investors as everyday puts expired worthless, resulting in market makers making huge profits. As the rally continued, market makers stopped hedging the puts they were selling. After all, there was no point in hedging because the stock market went up everyday.
In yesterday’s Afternoon Capsule, we shared with you that the Treasury auction was weak.
The weak Treasury auction caused the stock market to turn down. Market makers were caught flat footed as they had sold lots of puts without hedging. As the market went down, market makers were forced to sell stocks to hedge the puts they had sold.
The result of the surprise encountered by market makers was they were forced to sell stocks to hedge, causing the biggest sell-off since September.
The sell-off came just before the traditional Santa Claus rally.
Traditionally, the Santa Claus rally starts tomorrow.
The sell-off yesterday illustrates why it is so important for all investors to deeply understand market mechanics. Due to their very high value, Wall Street professionals keep the secrets of market mechanics close to the chest, making it difficult for most investors to understand market mechanics even when they try. To help you, we have made it easy for you to know, understand, and apply Wall Street’s best kept secrets. There are several podcasts in Arora Ambassador Club. You can join the exclusive Arora Ambassador Club by invitation only.

On Wednesday, Ark Invest purchased a total of 111,387 shares of the Elon Musk-led electric vehicle company. The purchase was made through its flagship ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK) and ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSE:ARKW). For the day, Tesla shares closed 3.92% lower at $247.14.

Here's a look at the predictions and what investors need to know from Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives.  
AI Goes Mainstream: Artificial intelligence was one of the most talked about terms in 2023 thanks to a $10 billion investment in ChatGPT parent OpenAI by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and the rising use cases. Ives thinks the growth of AI is just getting started.
""We believe AI is the biggest transformation in the tech sector in the last 30 years and is a ‘1995 Moment' not seen since the start of the internet in 1995,"" Ives said.
Ives said that artificial intelligence could make up 8% to 10% of IT budgets in 2024, which would be up from less than 1% of budgets in 2023. The AI sector could see over $1 trillion in spending over the next decade.
Apple Introduces the AI App Store: The app store from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has helped boost its services revenue over the years. Ives said that Apple may introduce its AI App Store at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in 2024, which will likely be held in June.
Ives said Apple’s services revenue could hit $5 billion annually once the new app store is introduced.
M&A Ramps in Big Tech: A prediction from Ives calls for mergers and acquisitions to happen in the technology sector, led by some of the biggest names.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, tracked by the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ), hit 16,800 points in early morning trading in New York, marking a year-to-date performance of 54%, the strongest since the dot-com boom of 1999.
Currently, 92% of the stocks in the Nasdaq 100 index have risen above their respective 50-day moving averages, indicating widespread gains in the tech sector.
But the robust bullish sentiment was not limited to tech stocks alone. All 11 S&P 500 sectors traded in the green. 
Small caps included in the Russell 2000, as tracked by the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM), are once again outperforming large-cap indices, reaching their highest point since August 2022.
The dollar continues to weaken as the markets ignore the warnings from Fed officials. Following presidents John C. Williams, Loretta Mester and Austan Goolsbee, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin also joined the list of figures urging caution regarding rate cuts.
Barkin stated the Fed is making good progress in addressing inflation but cautioned it’s too early to discuss rate cuts.

With more than 40% of respondents expressing their intention to tighten their belts this festive season, what stands out most is the resilience of the younger generations when it comes to their holiday shopping plans. In fact, millennials and Generation Z seem least inclined to reduce their holiday expenditures. 
However, to maintain a healthy spending pattern, the survey also sheds light on a significant surge in the adoption of “Buy Now, Pay Later” services within this population cohort. This shift in payment preferences suggests holiday spending might extend into the early months of the following year, potentially boosting overall holiday sales.

CPI
Please click here for a chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows that in the early trade this morning, the stock market broke above the top band of the mini resistance zone.
The chart shows that as of this writing the breakout appears to be failing.
Stock market bulls ran up the stock market Friday and yesterday in anticipation of lower inflation numbers.
This morning, before the release of CPI data, the momo crowd was aggressively buying stocks. This is inline with the momo crowd’s pattern. They buy ahead of key events hoping for better numbers. In contrast, smart money tends to not buy before an event because they understand there is risk if the numbers are worse than expected.
CPI came slightly worse than the consensus but significantly worse than the whisper numbers. Here are the details:

Headline CPI came at 0.1% vs. 0.0% consensus.
Core CPI came at 0.3% vs. 0.3% consensus.
However, it is important for prudent investors to note that whisper numbers flying around Friday and yesterday for Core CPI were 0.1%.  


The momo crowd bought immediately after the release of CPI, but smart money stepped in to sell the rally.
The consensus in the stock market now is that the Fed will cut interest rates five times in 2024, and the first cut will be in March.
Prudent investors should take the stock market consensus with a grain of salt. In The Arora Report analysis, the reasons are very simple.

0.3% core inflation is 3.6% annualized. The Fed’s target is 2%. The Fed is not about to change its target.  
Powell is very aware of Burns’s blunder and does not want to repeat it. Arthur Burns was perhaps the most intelligent Chairman of the Fed. He lowered interest rates when inflation came down, but then inflation came roaring back and he had to raise interest rates again. This is known as Burns’s blunder.


As an actionable item, the sum total of the foregoing is in ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","Economics,Markets,Tech"

The Fed’s Problem
Please click here for a chart of Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ: QQQ).
Note the following:

The chart shows that the stock market has had a significant rally since the beginning of November.
The chart shows Arora buy signals.
The chart shows that the stock market is consolidating right at the low band of the resistance zone.
RSI shows that the stock market can go either way but the probability to the upside is higher.
CPI data will be released tomorrow at 8:30am ET, and PPI will be released on Wednesday at 8:30am ET. Both have the potential to move the stock market, but the market will really be waiting for the Fed.
The FOMC meeting starts tomorrow. The FOMC rate decision will be announced Wednesday at 2pm ET followed by Powell’s press conference at 2:30pm.
The Fed has a problem. In The Arora Report analysis, the rise in the stock market has considerably loosened financial conditions. Financial conditions have become significantly looser than the Fed likely wants at this time.
In The Arora Report analysis, the Fed needs to be very careful as the stock market is positioned to twist whatever the Fed and Powell say to move the runaway stock market train faster. Here is the key question for investors: Will the Fed be able to put the breaks on the runaway stock market train?
The primary driver behind the runup in the stock market is a group of three market mechanics. Historically, market rallies driven by these market mechanics at this time of the year take a pause or even have a slight pullback right about now, before another leg up.  The tentative plan is to use any pullback to buy. The more you understand about market mechanics, the more money you will extract from the markets. To help you, a new podcast titled “Market Mechanics Trump Mother Of All Reports – A Look Ahead” is in production.  The podcast will be in Arora Ambassador Club.

The sentiment remains fragile, with the S&P 500 Index closing in the red Wednesday for its third consecutive day. The market is questioning whether it may have overestimated the possibility of five interest rate cuts in 2024, starting in March.
Yields on Treasuries are showing a slight uptick, with the 10-year yield rising by 5 basis points to reach 4.15%. Demand for a Federal Reserve repo facility has surged to its highest level since 2020 this week, indicating that some financial institutions fear a forthcoming liquidity drain. 
Meanwhile, the Japanese yen has made a remarkable rally, gaining over 1.4% against the dollar and reaching its highest levels in nearly four months.

The newly released Automatic Data Processing Inc (NASDAQ: ADP) data supports a Goldilocks economy. ADP is the largest payroll processor in the country and uses its data to give an advanced glimpse of the jobs picture ahead of the official jobs report that will be released on Friday at 8:30am ET.

ADP employment change came at 103K vs. 127K consensus.


There is more good news for the stock market but not so much for working people.

Q3 Unit Labor Costs-Rev. came at -1.2% vs. -0.8% consensus. Unit labor costs going down is a big positive for the stock market.  


Productivity in the U.S. has taken a remarkable jump.

Moody’s is cutting China’s credit outlook to negative. This indicates that the risk of default by China has increased. Moody’s call has been triggered by the property sector crisis and local government debt. The largest property developer in China, Evergrande, took more than $300B, mostly from individuals, to buy properties but never built them. Evergrande is close to liquidation.

Making Money In Bitcoin
Please click here for a chart of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC).
Note the following:

On Friday when bitcoin was trading around $38,000, we wrote:

Crypto bulls are hoping that whales will take advantage of low liquidity over the weekend and drive bitcoin above $40,000. A move above $40,000 will suck in more retail investors.


The Arora Report writing from Friday has now proven prescient. Whales took advantage of the low liquidity over the weekend to push bitcoin over $40,000. When bitcoin crossed $40,000, retail investors jumped in. Whales knew from the past behavior of retail investors that they would jump in after bitcoin crossed $40,000. This is exactly what happened. Retail investors jumped in, driving bitcoin to $42,000.
The chart shows when speculation about spot bitcoin ETF started. This was a trigger for this leg of the up move in bitcoin.
The chart shows the first resistance zone.
Now that whales have pushed bitcoin over $40,000, bitcoin promoters are pushing as hard as they can to bring in more retail investors to move bitcoin to the first resistance zone. Promoters’ pitch to retail investors is that there are trillions of dollars of institutional money waiting to invest in bitcoin. They give this as the reason for retail investors to aggressively buy now.
Prudent investors need to understand that whales and bitcoin promoters have an agenda. That agenda may not be in your best interest.
Bitcoin halving is coming early next year and that will also push bitcoin higher.
While bitcoin is moving higher, there are outflows from bitcoin exchanges worth more than $1B. On the surface, this seems negative, but this is a favorite technique of the whales to push bitcoin higher. Outflows from exchanges are promoted by bitcoin promoters as a commitment from investors to hold bitcoin for the long term.
Historically, outflows from exchanges have led to a rise in bitcoin.
There are three keys to making money in bitcoin:

Understand the behavior of whales
Understand that bitcoin has none of the benefits on a large scale that promoters have fed to investors
If a spot bitcoin is approved, it will lessen the ability of whales to run it up ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","Cryptocurrency,Economics,Markets,Trading Ideas"

Note the following:

The chart shows that the stock market is consolidating right below the mini resistance zone.
The RSI pattern on the chart shows that the stock market can go either way.
The stock market is up this morning due to positive earnings from Salesforce Inc (NYSE: CRM). Salesforce is in the Global X Dow 30 Covered Call ETF (ARCA: DJIA). Buying is also coming in due to strong earnings from Snowflake Inc (NYSE: SNOW) and Synopsys Inc (NASDAQ: SNPS). All three companies are benefiting from AI. 
The just released economic data shows that consumer spending is finally beginning to taper from excessive levels relative to incomes. Here are the details:

Personal spending came at 0.2% vs. 0.2% consensus.
Personal income came at 0.2% vs. 0.2% consensus.


The latest data on the Fed’s favorite inflation gauge PCE has disappointed both bulls and bears. Bears were pinning their hopes that PCE would be worse than expected and thereby cause a big drop in the stock market. Bulls were pinning their hopes on PCE triggering another leg of the stock market rally. PCE came inline with expectations, a scenario that neither bulls nor bears had expected. Here are the details:

Headline PCE came at 0.0% vs. 0.1% consensus.
Core PCE came at 0.2% vs. 0.2% consensus.


Weekly Initial Claims came at 218K vs. 215K consensus. This indicates that the jobs picture is staying very strong.

In a Monday conference call, Subramanian shared that the institution is favoring cyclicals over the high-flying Magnificent 7, which includes tech giants such as Apple Inc.

ZSHlR-C_AdPzmPghhsi5mzfoTEMslkTFFpmA260Cxe0,2023-11-28 13:05:39,Active ETFs Appear Booming In 2023 — Tema ETFs Are Taking Them Into A New Direction,https://www.benzinga.com/etfs/23/11/35976659/active-etfs-appear-booming-in-2023-tema-etfs-are-taking-them-into-a-new-direction,META,Benzinga,"The rapid emergence of the ETF industry, marked by its AuM growth from $1 trillion to $10 trillion this past decade, was driven by passive indexed funds which thrived in a low-rates, low-volatility environment. These funds offered low cost, low differentiation solutions to retail investors.  
As institutional investors overtake retail investors in ETF adoption, the landscape of the industry is set for a paradigm shift. The limitations of indexes are becoming increasingly apparent in a macro environment characterized by higher rates and higher volatility, which could stick around in the decade to come. The fundamental analysis and risk management that had been left behind by index funds are suddenly relevant again. Investors are consequently exploring alternative vehicles for their public equity exposures, namely active ETFs. 
Tema is one of the first independent thematic active ETF asset managers, but unlike competitors, is concentrating on underpenetrated, generational thematic trends that were previously inaccessible to investors. These themes include reshoring, oncology, luxury goods, cardiology and metabolics (Obesity and diabetes), and monopolies and oligopolies. 
The vulnerabilities of passive ETFs are becoming more apparent in the current environment 
Limited by the rigid nature of their underlying indices, passive funds lack the ability to dynamically respond and adapt to increasingly rapid and sharp changes in environment. These limitations undermine risk management efficacy and can ultimately compound risks for their investors. 
An example is the special premature rebalance the Nasdaq 100 index had to undergo this past summer. The disparity in performance within the index had over-concentrated its value, with the “Magnificent seven”, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ: APPL), Meta (NASDAQ: META), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), reaching 55% of the index’s total value. The “special rebalance” not only revealed the concentration risks tied to indexation, but also exposed the arbitrage and front-running risks that passive vehicles can be exposed to, at the detriment of investors.

The AI frenzy isn’t expected to die down anytime soon, and an analyst at Morgan Stanley is underlining key AI debates that will likely be triggered in the upcoming year.
Analyst Brain Nowak said these AI developments will have meaningful ramifications for the internet industry, tech sector and overall economy.
Personal AI Assistants: One of the debates will be centered around which companies will launch and scale the most compelling generative AI-enabled personal digital assistants, Nowak said in a recent note. Companies will likely focus on progressing toward a universal interface, removing friction and agentic AI integration, he said. These factors will determine user adoption and engagement, he said.
Nowak sees Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (GOOGL) as the best-positioned to enable personal AI assistant technology, followed by Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).
Future Of Search: Alphabet’s OpenAI rival Gemini will likely improve accuracy rates and reduce hallucination and likely narrow the competitive gap between OpenAI and Google, Nowak said.
AI Creator Tools: All eyes are on whether 2024 will see scaled generative AI creative tools and how these will impact broader engagement trends, the analyst said.

Analysts David J. Kostin, Ben Snider and Ryan Hammond expect the U.S. economy to continue its modest expansion through 2024, staving off recession risks. 
The team forecasted a 5% increase in corporate earnings, with market valuation estimated to remain steady at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 18x. 
While a 6% projected return for the broader market slightly underperformed the typical 8% average return seen in presidential election years, it depends crucially on sustained economic growth and a stable market environment.
Steady Growth Amidst Election Year
According to Goldman Sachs, the persistence of robust economic growth early in the year is expected to lead the market to reassess its current predictions of Federal Reserve rate cuts starting in the second quarter.
Additionally, uncertainties surrounding the U.S. presidential election was likely to dampen risk appetite in the first half.

After a surprisingly sharp drop in the Consumer Price Index on Tuesday, a similar trend emerged on Wednesday with the Producer Price Index also declining more than anticipated. 
October retail sales data revealed a modest 0.1% decrease for the month, which was more favorable than the projected 0.3% fall.
Traders are nearly fully factoring in the likelihood of the Federal Reserve maintaining steady interest rates in December while anticipating four rate reductions next year.
These adjusted expectations for interest rates have sparked an upsurge in major tech stocks. 
The “Magnificent Seven” group, featuring prominent tech giants like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon Inc.

New Important Economic Data
Please click here for a chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows the gap up yesterday and the follow up rally on better than expected Consumer Price Index (CPI).
The chart shows the mini resistance zone that is the next magnet.
RSI on the chart shows that the stock market is very overbought in the short term. However, this is common when market mechanics of positioning and year end chase take over. Market mechanics are very powerful. About two thirds of the stock market rise this year is due to market mechanics. Wall Street professionals closely guard the details of market mechanics because of their very high value. For those who want to take their investing to the next level, there are several podcasts on market mechanics in Arora Ambassador Club.
The chart shows that the stock market was running up earlier this morning prior to the release of important economic data on follow through momentum from yesterday.
There is more good news on inflation from the Producer Price Index (PPI). Here are the details:

Headline PPI came at -0.5% vs. 0.1% consensus. This is the biggest decline since April 2020.
Core PPI came at 0.0% vs. 0.3% consensus.


For a split second, futures rose on better than expected PPI, but then the data on retail sales gave investors pause.
Here are the details of retail sales data:

Headline retail sales came -0.1% vs. -0.3% consensus.
Retail sales ex-auto came at 0.1% vs. -0.2% consensus.


In The Arora Report analysis, even though retail sales are better than the consensus, they are worse than the whisper numbers that were floating around yesterday.  
Further in The Arora Report analysis, retail sales data shows that the consumer buying binge is beginning to slow down. We projected months ago that consumer liquidity will start tightening up beginning in late October. The just released data shows the Arora call was spot on. Even though consumer liquidity is starting to tighten, the consumer still has significant liquidity to continue ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","Cryptocurrency,Economics,Markets,Trading Ideas"

Deploy Cash And Reduce Hedges
The trigger for the call to deploy cash and reduce hedges is two-fold:

Market mechanics of year end chase. This market mechanic results in money managers aggressively buying stocks even if their opinion of the stock market is bearish.
Lower than expected CPI.

Please scroll down to the Protection Band And What To Do Now section for the changes. The changes should be made in small tranches, especially if the stock market pulls back after this morning’s spike up.
CPI
Please click here for a chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows that the stock market is ripping higher this morning on better than expected CPI.
The chart shows that the next target is the mini resistance zone.
The chart shows when hedges were reduced previously. The prior call was to deploy more cash. Now, there is a new call to deploy more cash and reduce hedges further.
RSI on the chart shows that the market is overbought. If the market pulls back due to overbought conditions, the pullback should be used to deploy more cash and reduce hedges.
CPI came better than expected. Here are the details:

Headline CPI came at 0.0% vs. 0.1% consensus.
Core CPI came at 0.2% vs. 0.3% consensus.


Home Depot Inc (NYSE: HD) earnings have broader implications. Home Depot is also in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (ARCA: DJIA). Home Depot reported earnings slightly better than the consensus. Prudent investors should note that Home Depot expects fiscal year earnings to be down 9% - 11% and same store ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","News,Earnings,Cryptocurrency,Economics,Markets,Trading Ideas"

Wall Street Mechanics Kicking In

Note the following:

The chart shows that TLT fell yesterday.
As we shared with you in the Afternoon Capsule, the reason for the fall in TLT was the poor Treasury auction. For details, see yesterday’s Afternoon Capsule.
Initially stocks fell on the poor Treasury auction, but the momo crowd bought the dip. Then came Powell’s statement that he was willing to raise rates if needed. The poor Treasury auction and Powell’s statement was a one-two punch that brought in more selling yesterday.
The chart shows that TLT is being bought this morning but still has a ways to go before reaching the lower resistance zone.
This morning Wall Street mechanics are kicking in, bringing in buyers in both stocks and bonds.
University of Michigan consumer confidence and inflation expectation data will be released at 10am ET. The data may be market moving.
The biggest data point ahead is CPI that will be released on November 14.
Remember that it is Friday, and short squeezes tend to occur on Fridays. In the early trade, there are signs of a short squeeze.

Good News
Please click here for a chart of oil futures.
Note the following:

The chart shows when Hamas attacked Israel.
The fear was that Iran would open a second northern front against Israel, escalating the Middle East war.
The U.S. responded by sending two aircraft carrier groups to the Middle East to deter Iran and its proxies from opening a northern front against Israel.
The falling trendline on the chart shows that investors came to believe there was a rethink in Iran as it appeared not to directly fight the U.S.
The latest drop in oil shown on the chart came after the U.S. sent a nuclear submarine.
The indication from our sources is that Iran is concluding that fighting the U.S. directly will be a losing proposition.
RSI on the chart shows that oil is now very oversold.
Temporarily, the U.S. military might has won. However, prudent investors need to keep in mind that the Middle East is very volatile and things can change very quickly.
The U.S. is staying on the offensive. The latest is that U.S. fighters bombed a weapons depot used by Islamic Revolutionary Guard of Iran in Syria.
Oil coming down is deflationary.
Oil coming down is raising hopes that the Fed will soon start cutting rates.
As speculation builds of the Fed cutting rates, there is a distinct possibility of a second short squeeze leg in bonds. If the second short squeeze leg in bonds starts, it in turn will trigger another rally in the stock market.
For the time being, stocks have to contend with technically overbought conditions.

Please click here for a chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows that the stock market has now moved above the top support zone.
The chart shows that the move down below the top support zone in late October has temporarily proven to be a bear trap.
RSI on the chart shows that the stock market is overbought. Overbought markets tend to be vulnerable to the downside.
As we have shared with you before, three macro events triggered a vicious short squeeze in bonds, which in turn, led to an epic rally in stocks.
In The Arora Report analysis, the first leg of the short squeeze in bonds is now over. 
There is Fed speak from Neel Kashkari and Austin Goolsbee. Powell will be speaking later in the week.
It is clear from the Fed speak that there is not clarity at the Fed regarding the following:

The real reason behind the rapid rise in long term rates in October
Implications now for future Fed policy of long term rates pulling back since Wednesday last week

The Morning Capsule is about the big picture, not an individual stock. The chart of BRK.B stock is being used to illustrate the point.
The chart shows the stock of Warren Buffett’s company Berkshire Hathaway broke out earlier this year.
The chart shows that the breakout failed.
The chart shows a big rally in BRK.B stock last week.
The latest report shows that Buffett is holding record cash of $157B.
At a time when Buffett is holding record cash, his stock portfolio shrank from $353B at the end of the prior quarter to $319B at the end of the last quarter.
Buffett’s major holdings, Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), American Express Company (NYSE: AXP), and Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO), all showed losses. You will benefit from analysis of all 41 stocks in Buffett’s portfolio. The easiest way is to listen to the podcast series analyzing all 41 stocks in Buffett’s portfolio in Arora Ambassador Club.
You may be wondering where Buffett is holding his cash. He is holding his cash in T-bills. Holding cash in T-bills has been The Arora Report’s recommendation. Please see the “Protection Band And What To Do Now” section below. 
Thank you for all of your questions wanting to know why the stock market rally was so explosive last week. Here is your answer. Hedge funds had a record negative positioning in Treasuries. When Treasuries moved higher in response to three macro events that we shared with you in the Capsules last week, a massive short squeeze in Treasuries took place. The movement in Treasuries, in turn, caused the largest rally in stocks. Many of you are also asking for an in-depth podcast on this subject ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","Asia,Macro Economic Events,Commodities,Economics,Markets"

Market Mechanics
Please click here for a chart of Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL).
Note the following:

The Morning Capsule is about the big picture, not an individual stock. A chart of AAPL stock is being used to illustrate the point.
AAPL is the largest stock and carries heavy weight in the indexes. For this reason, AAPL stock is very important to the stock market. Apple reports earnings after the market close.
The chart shows that AAPL stock made a lower low below the support/resistance zone.
The chart shows that AAPL stock moved up back into the support/resistance zone yesterday on the Fed and market mechanics induced rally.
Market mechanics continue to drive aggressive stock buying this morning.
Apple has been showing declining growth for several quarters, and Apple has China troubles. AAPL stock is also very expensive. However, none of the traditional fundamentals seem to matter in the case of Apple because a large number of investors believe in Apple and they want to buy AAPL stock.
We will be carefully looking at Apple’s sales in China, iPhone sales, services growth, and AI plans. The mention of AI is still very powerful. For example, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) reported weak earnings Tuesday. After earnings, the stock fell to $94, but aggressive buying came in when the company gave rosie projections of its AI chip. The stock moved up $14 from its low.
The all important jobs report will be released Friday at 8:30am ET. The jobs report will test the budding rally in stocks.
Initial jobless claims came at 217K vs. 214K consensus. This indicates that the jobs picture is staying strong. Initial jobless claims is a leading indicator and carries heavy weight in our adaptive ZYX Asset Allocation Model with inputs in ten categories. In plain English, adaptiveness means that the model changes itself with market conditions. Please click here to see how this is achieved. One of the reasons behind The Arora Report’s unrivaled performance in both ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","Earnings,Economics,Markets,Trading Ideas"

The results came amid an exciting earnings season. Here are some key analyst takeaways from the earnings release.
BofA Securities On Pinterest
Analyst Justin Post upgraded the rating from Neutral to Buy, while raising the price target from $32 to $37.
Pinterest's position versus its peers has significantly improved, as every quarter it shifts from underperformance towards outperformance, which is expected in the fourth quarter, Post said in the upgrade note.
The company has ""better expense discipline than expected with potential for further margin/EBITDA upside, we are above Street for EBITDA,"" the analyst wrote. ""Renewed confidence in new mgmt team given recent product execution and direct response (DR) disclosures,"" he added.
KeyBanc Capital Markets On Pinterest
Analyst Justin Patterson maintained an Overweight rating, while raising the price target from $35 to $37.
Pinterest reported its third-quarter revenues, EBITDA and MAUs (monthly active users) higher than the Street expectations, Patterson said in a note.
The company’s results “reinforce that growth is reaccelerating while expense controls remain intact, resulting in a ~600 bps inflection in 2023E EBITDA margin,” the analyst stated. “We anticipate an annual margin expansion cadence of 200-300 bps y/ y in 2024 and 2025, reflecting mid-teens growth from product innovation and partnerships,” he added.

The Folly Of Investor Celebration
Please click here for a chart of iShares 20 Plus Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ: TLT).
Note the following:

The chart shows when The Arora Report predicted that a record supply of Treasuries was ahead. A record supply meant higher yields and lower bond prices.
With the benefit of hindsight, The Arora Report prediction has proven spot on.
The chart shows that since the Arora call, there has been a significant drop in bond prices.
The chart shows that bonds are consolidating significantly below the lower resistance zone.
We shared with you in yesterday’s Afternoon Capsule:

The announcement from the U.S. Treasury is adding to the buying pressure in stocks. Here are the details of the Treasury announcement:


From October to December, the Treasury will borrow $776B. In The Arora Report analysis, this amount is $76B less than the consensus.

From January to March, the Treasury will borrow $816B.


That is $1.592T of borrowing over six months. Investors are celebrating by buying stocks. What is wrong with this picture? Celebrating this level of borrowing is a folly.
The second part of the Treasury announcement is still ahead. In the Treasury’s issuance announcement, the Treasury will provide details of the duration of the notes and bonds it will be selling.
Details of the issuance have the potential to move the yields, and in return bonds, by a large amount.  If more issuance is of long duration, long term yields will rise. If most of the issuance is in the short term, the impact is uncertain.
In The Arora Report analysis, the Treasury issuance statement is of utmost importance to stock investors. If yields rise further on long term bonds, this will be a negative for the stock market. On the other hand, if yields fall, it will be a positive for the stock market.
The FOMC meeting starts today. The FOMC decision will be announced at 2:00pm ET tomorrow followed by Powell’s press conference at 2:30 pm ET.
In The Arora Report analysis, Treasury issuance announcement is more important for investors than the Fed decision.
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) is an important stock for the sentiment in the stock market. As of this writing, TSLA stock is trading below $200. The reason for the drop is two fold:

Buying On Iran, Ignoring Apple
Please click here for a chart of Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL).
Note the following:

The Morning Capsule is about the big picture, not an individual stock. The chart of AAPL stock is being used to illustrate the point.
This morning investors are aggressively buying stocks on no military response from Iran or its proxies over the weekend to Israeli actions in Gaza.
Investors are ignoring the potential bad news on Apple. Apple is the largest stock and carries a very heavy weight in the indexes.
There are reports that many Chinese are abandoning iPhones in favor of Huawei’s Mate 60 Pro.
The chart shows when the Morning Capsule read,

Another challenge to Apple is a chip breakthrough in China leading to Huawei Mate 60 Pro. Previously due to the U.S. chip sanctions, Huawei was not able to produce a 5G phone. In a breakthrough, Semiconductor Manufacturing International, aka SMIC, a Chinese state-owned chip manufacturer was able to produce an advanced chip. Before the U.S. ban, Huawei had 12% of the smartphone market globally.  Especially in China, the ban benefited Apple. The U.S. government is concerned and investigating how Huawei was able to produce such an advanced phone. This is an important subject for investors.


As a member of The Arora Report, you have had an advanced notice of Apple’s trouble in China through various posts.
China is also targeting Apple’s largest supplier Foxconn with tax audits and land use audits. Foxconn is the main assembler of iPhones.
The chart shows that after the iPhone 15 release, attempts to break above the top band of the support/resistance zone have failed.
The chart shows that AAPL stock is currently below the low band of the support/resistance zone.
The chart shows that members of The Arora Report were able to buy AAPL stock last year at a lucrative price when it dipped in the Arora buy zone.

The analyst expects AMD to deliver in-line 3Q23 earnings results on mixed-end market trends with more robust data center and PC CPU dynamics, offset by weaker enterprise, embedded, and PC gaming.
Mosesmann sees a more robust 4Q23 outlook above consensus expectations as data center CPU share gains continue to accelerate (amid inventory normalization), a return to gaming seasonality that offsets embedded weakness and console weak seasonality.
Mosesmann expects AMD to strike a bullish posture in all strategic product areas, including the new MI300A/X APU/GPU compute accelerators, which he sees as much more competitive than the Street believes. 
AMD is installing MI300A into the El Capitan supercomputer for the LLNL and the MI300X (sampling) to ramp early in 2024 in volume in the discrete GPU accelerator segment vs. Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA) Hopper and Intel Corp (NASDAQ: INTC) Gaudi 2/3.

That said, data suggests S&P 500 companies may be on track to break a fourth-quarter earnings-declining streak. 
A Mixed Bag Laced With Caution: Last week, Investors reacted to disappointing earnings reports from some high-profile companies such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG). The former spooked investors with softer-than-expected cloud revenue and the latter with its cautious guidance. 
Two of the fellow “Magnificent Seven,” namely Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) calmed investors’ nerves, either with stellar results or positive commentary regarding the near term. Chip earnings were also a mixed bag, with Texas Instruments, Inc. (NASDAQ:TXN) reporting a third-quarter miss, while Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC) cheered investors with a solid beat and positive outlook.
Energy giants Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX) reported below-consensus earnings for the quarter, and this served as a drag on the profit growth of S&P 500 companies.
Midway into the season, about 49% of the S&P 500 companies have released their earnings so far, with 78% of the companies reporting earnings beats and 62% ringing in revenue upside, data from FactSet shows.
The year-over-year blended earnings growth rate of S&P 500 companies is expected at 2.7%, potentially marking the first growth since the third quarter of 2022.
Earnings Deluge Awaits:  The tech earnings news flow continues in the unfolding week, with the likes of Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and Qualcomm, Inc.

Power Of AI
Please click here for a chart of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN).
Note the following:

The Morning Capsule is about the big picture, not an individual stock. The chart of AMZN stock is being used to illustrate the point.
The chart shows when Amazon earnings were released.
The chart shows that the stock rallied on release of earnings. Earnings were better than the consensus and whisper numbers. A stock moves based on the difference between reported earnings and projections compared to the whisper numbers. Whisper numbers are the numbers that analysts provide privately to their best clients.
The profit engine of Amazon is AWS, its cloud computing service. As investors look below the surface, there is a slight miss in cloud computing revenues.
The chart shows that the stock gave up its gain on cloud computing data.
The chart shows when Amazon made a comment that AWS will make ‘tens of billions’ from generative AI.
The chart shows that AMZN stock staged a strong rally on this comment.
In The Arora Report analysis, the reaction in AMZN stock on just the comment after missing the revenues shows the power of just talking about AI to move up stocks is still there. There has been a concern that stocks going up on AI talk has run its course.  In The Arora Report analysis, starting next quarter, investors will want to see actual earnings and revenue gains from AI. A fortune is to be made in AI over the next seven years. It is not going to be a straight line. At times, it is going to be treacherous. Those who take time to develop more in-depth knowledge will make significantly more money than those who do not take the time to develop in-depth knowledge, even when receiving the same signals. The best way to develop your investing knowledge about AI is to listen to the podcasts in Arora Ambassador Club.  
The just released economic data shows that the consumer continues to binge. Here are the details:

Personal spending came at 0.7% vs. 0.5% consensus.
Personal income came at 0.3% vs. 0.4% consensus.


In The Arora Report analysis, the pattern in the data has been and continues to be that consumers’ spending has been going up more than the rise in their incomes.  Where is the money coming from?  The data just released shows that consumers are dipping into their savings that they built from free money programs. The other data shows that consumers without savings are running up higher balances on their credit cards.

KeyBanc Capital Markets On Meta Platforms
Analyst Justin Patterson maintained an Overweight rating while raising the price target from $356 to $380.
“On the call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated that Meta is continuing to focus on operating efficiency, and will be deprioritizing non-AI projects to shift resources toward AI,” Patterson said in a note. “Reels is now net neutral to revenue, which is one quarter ahead of our estimate,” he added.
“Our view is Meta can remain a LDD% revenue and EPS compounder as growth initiatives (e.g., Reels, AI products) dovetail with an ongoing focus on operating efficiency,” the analyst further stated.
BofA Securities On Meta Platforms
Analyst Justin Post reiterated a Buy rating while lifting the price target from $375 to $384.
Meta Platforms reported third-quarter revenues ahead of expectations, driven by China advertiser spend, Post said.

As of midday trading in New York, all major U.S. stock indices were in negative territory, primarily due to a slump in the tech sector that had a broad impact on the market’s performance.
Despite reporting better-than-expected results, Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) faced challenges in its Cloud revenue growth, resulting in a significant 9% daily decline in its stock price — the most substantial daily drop in a year.
Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) saw a nearly 3.2% decline ahead of its quarterly earnings release scheduled after the market closes. Conversely, Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) ‘s shares surged by 3.9% following stronger-than-predicted quarterly results. 
Equity investor sentiment remained depressed as both oil prices and Treasury yields experienced increases. Market participants are anxiously awaiting the release of key GDP growth data scheduled for Thursday, which is expected to show a robust 4.3% increase. 
Cues From Thursday's Trading:
The S&P 500 fell 1.2%, falling below the 4,200 support and extending the decline since July’s peak to 9%. 
The Nasdaq 100 sharply underperformed, down 2%. Blue chips managed to contain losses, while small caps suffered a 1.4% drop.

Analyst Brad Erickson maintained a Sector Perform rating, while raising the price target from $9 to $10.
Snap’s third-quarter results were mixed, with the positives being the company’s solid revenue beat and ad tech improvement, Erickson said in a note.
“Less positively, growth rates remain well below the market even including inorganic subscription and while the war is impeding visibility, the company's reacceleration appears to be meaningfully lagging competitors leaving the same lingering question of whether SNAP get back to capturing marginal advertiser dollars in a more difficult macro,” the analyst wrote.

What Happened: On Monday, Kuo, an analyst at TF International Securities, shared his latest predictions and concerns about Apple’s future generative AI business/services. 
According to Kuo’s latest survey, Cupertino plans to procure 2,000 to 3,000 AI servers in 2023 and a more substantial 18,000 to 20,000 units in 2024. 
This investment represents only 1.3% of global AI server shipments in 2023 and 5% in 2024 and falls short compared to competitors like Meta, which is poised to purchase about 40,000 AI servers next year. 
See Also: Tesla CEO Elon Musk Is So Impressed By Apple’s iPhone 15 Photos That He Tells Tim Cook, ‘I’m Buying One’
The Supply Chain Challenge: Kuo said that Apple is buying fewer AI servers this year than in 2024 because there aren’t enough NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) AI chips available. Moreover, the tech giant ordered them later than some other big customers. 
However, the analyst also noted that while the ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","News,Analyst Color,Top Stories,Analyst Ratings,Tech,Media"

(NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), the third-largest corporation in the U.S. by market capitalization, is poised to unveil its much-anticipated third-quarter earnings report. 
Analysts’ consensus estimates suggest robust performance, with anticipated earnings per share (EPS) of $1.46 and revenue projected at $76.02 billion.
In terms of earnings projections, this would mark the highest performance since the fourth quarter of 2021 when Alphabet, the parent company of Google, reported EPS was $1.53, and would also reflect a remarkable 38% increase compared to the same quarter in 2022.
As for revenue expectations, they closely mirror the all-time highs of $76.05 billion achieved in the fourth quarter of 2022. Additionally, it would imply a substantial 10% rise compared to revenues reported in the same quarter of 2022.
The year 2022 was a challenging one for Alphabet, as it consistently fell short of Wall Street’s earnings and revenue estimates in each quarter of the year. However, 2023 has been a different story so far, with Alphabet consistently outperforming market expectations in both the first and second quarters.
Following the second quarter earnings announcement, Alphabet’s stock surged by nearly 6%, while it remained relatively stable ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","Analyst Color,Earnings,Large Cap,Price Target,Top Stories,Analyst Ratings,Tech"

Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) rallied 3.5% to break above $31,000, testing its 2023 highs, which were previously hit in mid-July. The largest cryptocurrency could mark its fifth straight session of gains, the longest streak since January. 
Notably, billionaire hedge fund investor Bill Ackman made headlines by announcing the covering of his short positions on U.S. Treasuries. This decision comes in response to growing global risks and mounting concerns of an impending economic slowdown.

Gold Bulls Excited
Please click here for a chart of gold ETF SPDR Gold Trust (ARCA:GLD).
Note the following:

The chart is a monthly chart to give you a long term perspective.
Long time members of The Arora Report know that The Arora Report has an unparalleled record of making accurate buy and sell calls on gold. Here are two Arora calls that have been credited with moving gold across the globe.

The chart shows an Arora sell signal given in 2011 at $1904 on exactly the day gold topped before falling to nearly $1000.
In 2016, when almost everyone on Wall Street had anointed Hillary Clinton as the next president, even before the election, The Arora Report was among a small minority that predicted Trump would win. On election night, as results came in and it became apparent that Trump would win, gold soared. At the exact top, The Arora Report gave a sell signal which was picked up by Arora Report members in Asia, which started a cascade of selling. Business Standard, the Wall Street Journal of India, credited The Arora Report with moving gold in its headline. Here is the Business Standard article: Arora Report Creates Ripples In Bullion Market.


The chart shows the resistance zone for gold.
The chart shows that gold has rallied to the bottom band of the resistance zone.
Gold bulls are excited, believing that this time gold may breakout above the resistance zone.
In The Arora Report analysis, if gold breaks above the resistance zone, there is significant room to run. There are several important observations about this gold move of interest to investors.

Gold does not like high interest rate. Normally, when interest rates go higher, gold moves down. Over the last two weeks, even though interest rates have been moving up, gold has continued to move up.
In The Arora Report analysis, if interest rates continue to rise, the gold rally may be stopped in its tracks.
Significant buying appears to be coming from Asia.
It is likely that central banks of countries like China, India, and Saudi Arabia are ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","Cryptocurrency,Economics,Markets,Trading Ideas"

The Week That Was: The blended year-over-year earnings of S&P 500 companies are expected to decrease by 0.4%, marking the fourth consecutive decline, according to Factset’s weekly earnings insights report. The decline in earnings is largely due to downward revisions in earnings per share (EPS) estimates for Pfizer, Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and Eli Lilly & Co. (NYSE:LLY).
Some of the notable disappointments from the past week include Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Nokia Oyj (NYSE:NOK), Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS), and Alcoa Corp. (NYSE:AA), among others. Additionally, there were negative preannouncements from companies like Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. (NYSE:HPE) and SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG).
Factset data indicates that out of the 17% of the S&P 500 companies that have reported so far, 73% have reported positive earnings per share (EPS) surprises, and 66% have reported positive revenue surprises.
The Week Ahead: With earnings from the financial sector tapering, tech companies are expected to take the spotlight this week. Investors will closely monitor earnings from communication services companies such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), along with software giant Microsoft Corporation (NYSE:MSFT) and e-commerce giant Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).

Long Term Perspective
Please click here for a 46 year chart of the 30-year U.S. Treasury yield.
Note the following:

Pay attention to the trendline on the chart.
The chart shows that the 40 year bull market in bonds is over.
Last year, The Arora Report made a major call. The prior similar major call by The Arora Report was in 2009. That call was to back up the truck and aggressively buy stocks. The 2009 call was made at the time of the great financial crash when S&P 500 had lost half of its value and most portfolios had lost 70% - 90% of their value. Most Wall Street strategists were issuing sell signals. Hindsight shows that the 2009 Arora call was spot on, as the call was made at the exact bottom before the start of a great bull market.
The Arora call made in 2022 was that the 40 year secular bull market in stocks had ended due to four megatrends ending. To help our members shift their thinking to prosper in the new era, for the first time since 2009 a special live event was held titled “A Forward Look At Investing 2023 - 2030.” If you missed the event, a recording is available in Arora Ambassador Club. 
Yesterday, 11 months after the Arora call on the four megatrends ending, Fed Chair Powell and President Biden confirmed that two of the megatrends have ended.
Powell confirmed that the deflationary era had ended, resulting in the end of the long bond bull market.

One of the four megatrends behind the Arora call was the end of the 40 year bond bull market.


Biden spoke to the nation and proposed spending $100B for Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan, and the southern border.

One of the four megatrends behind the Arora call was the end of the peace dividend since the Berlin Wall fell and the end of the Soviet Union.


The road ahead will be different from the road behind. To prosper in the new era, it is extremely important for investors, investment advisors, and money managers to not be stuck in the thinking that was appropriate for the 40 year secular bull market era.  If you stick with the old thinking, ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","Cryptocurrency,Economics,Markets,Tech,Trading Ideas"

The FOMC is now proceeding carefully, acknowledging that substantial tightening in financial conditions can result from an increase in bond yields, subsequently affecting policy decisions, Powell said. A period of above-trend growth may still imply “meaningful tightening” of interest rates, he said. 
In response to Powell’s comments being interpreted as dovish, traders scaled back their expectations for interest rate hikes. Presently, the market is pricing in a 96% probability that interest rates will remain unchanged in November.
Investors also reacted to mixed earnings from major U.S. corporations. Tesla, Inc. experienced a significant decline of more than 9%, marking its worst session since early January 2023, in response to disappointing earnings. On the other hand, Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) saw a 16% increase in its stock price, fueled by better-than-expected results and a substantial surge in subscribers. This performance marked the largest one-day increase for Netflix since January 2021.

Opportunity In Semiconductors
Please click here for a chart of  Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA).
Note the following:

The Morning Capsule is about the big picture, not an individual stock. The chart of TSLA is being used to illustrate the point.
TSLA is a very important stock because it is part of the magnificent seven.
The chart shows a big drop in TSLA stock on earnings.
The trendline on the chart shows that TSLA stock is in a downtrend.
Tesla has a good story in Cybertruck, FSD, lower cost than competitors, and energy business. However, Tesla has been hurt by rising interest rates.  In the conference call, Musk mentioned interest rates 11 times.
In The Arora Report analysis, there is a readthrough for the economy from Tesla earnings. After tax credits, Tesla cars are some of the cheapest cars in the U.S. now. Under certain circumstances, after tax credits, a consumer can now buy a brand new Model 3 for $24,000 in California. In spite of this advantage, Tesla is having difficulty. This indicates that although consumer spending continues to be strong, the consumer is pulling back on high ticket purchases.
There is good news from Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (NYSE: TSM). Taiwan Semiconductor is important because it is the largest semiconductor foundry for advanced chips, including the CPU in your iPhone. Taiwan Semiconductor profits fell by 25%.  However, this is better than the consensus. For the year ahead, TSM is predicting a drop in industry inventory levels. When inventories go down, that is typically the bottom of the semiconductor cycle. Historically, it pays to buy semiconductors when the cycle is bottoming. Two ETFs, artificial intelligence ETF Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (NASDAQ: AIQ) and semiconductor ETF VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH), are of special interest in the ZYX Allocation Model Portfolio. The portfolio is very overweight in semiconductors. Together, these two ETFs can have an allocation up to 23%. Investors need to keep in mind that there is no free lunch. Semiconductors have a high beta. In plain English, this means that they move a lot more than the market – to the upside and to the downside.

Market Mechanics
Please click here for a chart of West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures.
Note the following:

The chart shows that oil is jumping after a blast at a hospital in Gaza killed a large number of civilians.
Iran is calling for an oil embargo against Israel.
In The Arora Report analysis, given the presence of two US aircraft carrier groups near Israel, there is no chance of a potential oil embargo succeeding. 
Iran is also calling for Islamic countries to sanction Israel.
Arab leaders have canceled President Biden’s Jordan summit in reaction to the blast at the hospital in Gaza.
In The Arora report analysis, even though Arab countries such as Egypt and Jordan are dependent on US financial aid, and Gulf countries are dependent on the US for security, Arab leaders do not want to appear to be cooperating with Biden. The reason is that Arab leaders are afraid of unrest in their own countries and losing power. The outrage among their own populations over the hospital blast and continued bombardment of Gaza is approaching a boiling point.
Prudent investors should pay attention to political instability that may develop if the carnage in Gaza continues and there is no humanitarian relief for innocent people who are running out of food and water. In The Arora Report analysis, if political instability develops, oil prices will jump.
For investors, it is important to note that the hospital blast has blown Wall Street’s callous calculation. It is Wall Street’s callous calculation along with market mechanics that are responsible for the recent rise in the market. Please read prior Capsules regarding Wall Street’s callous calculation.

The chart shows that RSI has quickly become overbought. Even though overbought markets are vulnerable to a pull back, in the complete context of volume and price action, this quick move up in RSI is a positive for the market.
The chart shows that the market is consolidating above the top band of the top band of the support zone. This is a sign of technical strength. The primary reason behind the strength are the two market mechanics.

The market mechanic of positioning is to the upside.
The market mechanic of year end chase is to the upside.


Market mechanics are powerful. About two-thirds of the market rise this year is due to market mechanics. Understanding market mechanics can give you a big edge. Due to their high value, most of the knowledge about market mechanics is kept close to the chest of Wall Street professionals. The best way to learn about market mechanics is to listen to the podcast in Arora Ambassador Club.


The new data on consumer spending is unexpectedly strong. The US economy is 70% consumer based, therefore prudent investors pay attention to retail sales. Here are details of the new data:

Headline retail sales came in at 0.7% vs 0.3% consensus. 
Retail sales ex-auto came in at 0.6% vs 0.2% consensus.


In The Arora Report analysis, the reason retail sales continue to stay strong is due to the free money distributed by the Federal government through a number of programs during the pandemic. Now even though the headlines of free money have faded, the money that the Federal government borrowed and spent is still in the system. Further there is unprecedented spending by the Federal government under the Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Act. The money from these two acts will continue to flow for years.  Wealthy consumers still have significant savings, low end, and middle class consumers are borrowing more and charging more to their credit cards. Since consumers got into the habit of spending more, they are not likely to change that behavior until the money in the system starts drying up.
Yields are rising after the release of retail sales data.

A Thursday visit from Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Israel was confirmation of unconditional support from the U.S. for Israel in its war against Palestinian terrorist organization Hamas.
Israel’s military reported on Thursday afternoon that over 1,200 people, including at least 27 Americans, have been killed by Hamas’ attacks, with around 2,800 individuals injured. In response to these attacks, Israeli counterstrikes in Gaza have resulted in the deaths of approximately 1,537 individuals, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health, CBS News reported.
On Thursday morning, International Monetary Fund managing director Kristalina Georgieva expressed concern over how the conflict could affect global oil markets, which are liable to be disrupted by war in the Middle East, where roughly a third of the global oil output is produced.
While the specific area where the conflict is located is not a significant oil-producing region, major disruptions in the global oil markets could come if further conflict arises between the U.S. and Iran, a long-time backer of Hamas operations against Israel. 
Earlier this week the Iranian government denied having any relationship with the Hamas attacks, as Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said ""We defend Palestine, we defend the fights.""  This denial is contradicted by reports that Iran had a direct role in training Hamas for the latest attack on Israeli civilians, according to The Wall Street Journal.
While Congress is preparing a $2-billion aid package for Israel, several prominent U.S. politicians denounced Iran’s participation in the massacre, proposing a double-down on oil sanctions.

Hotter Consumer Inflation
Please click here for a chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows that the stock market ran up above the top band of the top support zone in anticipation of better than expected Producer Price Index (PPI) and Consumer Price Index (CPI) as well as the market mechanics of year end chase and market positioning.
Yesterday, we shared with you that PPI came hotter than expected, but bullish investors chose to ignore it. Please read yesterday’s Capsules for more on PPI. Bullish investors chose to pin their hopes on CPI coming better than expected and market mechanics.
This morning, CPI came worse than expected. Here are the details:

Headline CPI came at 0.4% vs. 0.3% month-over-month consensus.
Core CPI came at 0.3% vs. 0.3% month-over-month consensus. Of special note is that the whisper numbers for Core CPI were 0.2%. 
Wall Street was positioned for 0.2% Core CPI.


Now, there are two strikes against Wall Street positioning and bulls’ hopes in the form of PPI and CPI.
Stock futures were running up ahead of the release of CPI on hopes of better than expected numbers. On release of CPI, the stock market took a slight dip. The momo crowd aggressively bought the dip and is trying to run up the stock market as of this writing.
In The Arora Report analysis, even though progress is being made on inflation, core inflation is staying sticky, way above the Fed’s 2% target. This means that the Fed is likely to keep rates higher for longer but may be reluctant to raise rates. You may recall that The Arora Report’s call for a while has been that core inflation will stay sticky. So far, that call is spot on.
Earnings season starts tomorrow, although a fair number of earnings were reported this morning. Earnings are expected to be inline with consensus; however, earnings this morning are mixed.
Going forward, bulls’ faith in market mechanics to run up the stock market will be tested as their predictions on the data have been wrong.
Here are the probabilities of Fed interest rate hikes:

10% in November
33% in December


Initial jobless claims came at 209K vs. 214K consensus. This indicates that the job picture, especially at the low end, remains very strong. The job ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","Cryptocurrency,Economics,Federal Reserve,Markets,Trading Ideas"

Bank of America noted the impact artificial intelligence can have on several sectors going forward and made the claim it could be highly disruptive.
Here’s a look at several stocks and ETFs investors should know.
Artificial Intelligence Disruption: Multiple companies could benefit from the disruption of artificial intelligence. This has led investors to look for top names that could see revenue and earnings per share gains through the technology.
“It’s not just tech companies that will benefit from AI’s newest wave. Our view is that GenAI’s transformation will likely be similar to the transformation driven by past disruptive technologies like the telephone, automobile, personal computer and internet,” Bank of America analyst Alkesh Shah said.
The analyst compiled results from a survey of analysts to predict which sectors and stocks stand out for investors.
While most disruptive technologies have taken 15 to 30 years to reach mainstream adoption, the analyst said generative artificial intelligence could reach mainstream adoption faster than many expect.
“AI-driven efficiencies and incremental revenue may appear across sectors globally as soon as the next 3-5 years, far more rapidly than past technologies and investors may anticipate, indicating that upside potential may not be fully priced in.”
The economic impact of artificial intelligence could be $15.7 trillion by 2030 according to the analyst.

She also said that the bank had been buying up tech stocks as fears of effects of a US recession now look overblown. She made the comments on an interview on Bloomberg TV Wednesday.
“Putting geopolitics aside, the macroeconomic risk or the balance of the risks [of investing in global equities] has improved,” said Manthey.
“I don’t want to sound overly bullish as the data still looks bad, but it looks less bad than what we thought it would so the global economy will continue to improve despite these risks more than we expected it to do.”
Among emerging market stocks there has been a $1.8 trillion sell-off this year, taking stocks to their lowest levels vs. the S&P 500 since the 1980s. Manthey said that this made emerging market companies particularly attractive to Citi’s bargain hunters right now.

Hotter Producer Inflation
Please click here for a chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA: SPY)  which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows that the stock market moved up above the top band of the top support zone. The move up was driven primarily by market mechanics.
Bulls are confident that market mechanics will drive the stock market to the mini resistance zone shown on the chart.
Bulls have data to back up their belief. About two thirds of the market rise this year is due to market mechanics. Market mechanics tend to become extra powerful in November and December. Bulls are also pointing to the historical data that shows that the year end chase is to the upside in a year when the stock market has been up more than 10% going into the last quarter. Of course, prudent investors need to take into account the current conditions that are unique to this year. All investors should strive to develop deep knowledge of market mechanics to gain a big edge. Due to the high value, Wall Street professionals keep the details of market mechanics close to their chest. The best way to learn about market mechanics is to listen to the podcasts in Arora Ambassador Club.
Producer Price Index came hotter than expected. Here are the details:

Headline PPI came at 0.5% vs. 0.3% consensus.
Core PPI came at 0.3% vs. 0.2% consensus.


Wall Street has been positioned for better than expected PPI and CPI. Today PPI has dashed bulls’ hopes, but they are hanging tough, trusting that market mechanics will drive the stock market higher irrespective of the data.
CPI will be released tomorrow at 8:30am ET. The latest consensus is 0.3% for both the headline and core.
San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly commented that the neutral rate may now be at 3%. Stock market bulls are still hoping for ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","Cryptocurrency,Economics,Markets,Trading Ideas"

Positioning
Please click here for a chart of Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ: QQQ).
Note the following:

The chart shows that QQQ bounced from the top band of the mini support zone. This is a sign of strength for tech stocks.
The chart shows that unlike S&P 500 (SPX) SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY), QQQ did not even come close to the 200 day moving average. This is again a sign of relative strength of tech stocks.
The chart shows that RSI has quickly gone from oversold to overbought. This is due to the market mechanics of year end chase taking over.
Important inflation data is ahead.

PPI will be released on October 11 at 8:30am ET. Consensus for the headline is 0.3% and for core is 0.2%.
CPI will be released on October 12 at 8:30am ET. Consensus for both the headline and core is 0.3%.


In The Arora Report analysis, Wall Street is positioned for inflation numbers better than the consensus. Those interested in learning deeply about market mechanics of positioning, listen to the podcast “MARKET MECHANICS: POSITIONING.”

If the numbers come better than the consensus, Wall Street will be encouraged that they called it right. This will cause aggressive buying.
If the numbers come worse than the consensus, expect smart money to lightly sell and the market mechanic of year end chase to temporarily pause. Expect momo gurus to come up with a new narrative to persuade their followers to buy stocks.


The International Monetary Fund is raising its projections for inflation to 5.8% for the next year. Only three months ago, the IMF had made a project of 5.2%. In The Arora Report analysis, this is not good news: however as of this writing the crowd is oblivious as market mechanics have taken over.
There is plenty of Fed speak today that may move the markets, speakers include Raphael Bostic, Neel Kashkari, Christopher Waller, and Mary Daly. Investors are hoping that the Fed speakers will say the following:

Government Shutdown Averted; House Ousts McCarthy: The U.S. Congress managed to avoid a dramatic government shutdown just hours before the midnight deadline Oct. 1 by passing a stopgap funding bill. This bill ensures the continuation of government operations through Nov. 17, excluding new funding for border security and Ukraine. On Tuesday, the House of Representatives made a historic decision to oust Speaker Kevin McCarthy, following a motion initiated by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) in response to McCarthy’s collaboration with Democrats to prevent a government shutdown. 
Treasury Yields Surge, Bond Market Turmoil Persists: Throughout the week, yields across the Treasury curve continued to rise. The 10-year Treasury yield surged past 4.75%, reaching its highest level in 16 years. On Friday, the 30-year yield crossed the 5% threshold, driven by a jobs report that exceeded expectations.

Kolanovic suggests choosing cash at a 5.5% return in the money market, and short-term Treasurys is a crucial protection strategy right now.
The S&P 500 is teetering on the edge, with the specter of a five-week losing streak looming large. The index has already retreated over 5% in the past month.

McLennan, co-head of First Eagle's Global Value team, expresses concern over the equity and bond market’s relative complacency. As reported by CNBC, McLennan highlights that the U.S. government’s spending has surpassed tax revenues by a staggering $1.5 trillion over the past year, amounting to 5.5% of the nation’s GDP. He terms this as “highly unusual,” since budget deficits typically shrink near the peak of the economic cycle.

This comes after a few challenging weeks for Wall Street.
CNBC reported Cramer stating, “We certainly have plenty of tinder for a rally — there are some Kingsfords lying around, maybe even a Duraflame or two,” suggesting that a weak payroll number could lead to a rebound similar to what was seen in March.
The nonfarm payroll report, with its “true staying power,” is the key data point to watch, according to Cramer. He believes that if the figures show a higher-than-expected number of layoffs, the Federal Reserve might hesitate to raise interest rates, potentially pleasing the market.

Major Buying Opportunity Ahead

Note the following:

The chart shows that The Arora Report call that was made on August 2 was very timely and spot on.
The chart shows the dramatic drop in TLT.
The chart shows that the volume on the drop yesterday was a record. In The Arora Report analysis, this is one indication of potential capitulation. In general, it pays to buy when a capitulation occurs. However, this is only one of the several important capitulation indicators. For those wanting next-level information, listen to the podcast in Arora Ambassador Club titled “The Ten Secrets Of Epic Capitulation Riches.”
RSI on the chart shows that TLT is oversold and beginning to bounce. This indicates that if the macro data is favorable, TLT can move up quickly.
In The Arora Report analysis, the short interest in bonds right now is likely the highest ever. Assuming our analysis is correct, if favorable macro data is released, TLT can experience a major short squeeze and run up.  
In The Arora Report analysis, all of the foregoing is only short term. For the long term, The Arora Report has a negative view of bonds due to high debt levels, high deficits, and persistent inflation. 
Weak Automatic Data Processing Inc (NASDAQ: ADP) data this morning is lifting bonds, and in turn, stocks. ADP is the largest private payroll processor in the country. It uses its data to give a glimpse of the jobs picture ahead of the official jobs report that will be released on Friday.  ADP employment change came at 89K vs. 150K consensus.

The summer of 2023 came and went and we have nothing to show for it. Inflation and volatility are starting to creep back up and CNN’s Fear & Greed index is seeing red once again.
With all this uncertainty, many investors are wondering: is the U.S. stock market as bad as it seems? 
In some ways, it is. With a highly concentrated market rally and lingering inflation, there are legitimate things for retail investors to be worried about. However, history suggests that most of the market pain is already behind us. Let’s dig in.
The Bad
As I discussed earlier this year, at the end of May only seven stocks were responsible for the entire gain in the U.S. stock market in 2023. This lack of breadth was a major concern for me as only a handful of large companies were leading the rally in equities.
Unfortunately, this hasn’t changed much since. Though the market rally did broaden during the summer, recent losses have caused things to reverse course. As of late September, only 25 companies are responsible for the 12% year-to-date gain in U.S. stocks.
You can see this more clearly by looking at the number of stocks responsible for the gain in the Russell 3000 (a broad based U.S. stock index) this year:

Though this year’s rally started quite broadly, it has since become concentrated into relatively few companies. You know the names—Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Meta (NASDAQ: META), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), etc. This level of concentration suggests that there might be more weakness in the market than what the overall gain would suggest.
But, the lack of market breadth isn’t our only problem. We are also dealing with persistent inflation. Though CPI has come down from a high of 9% in June 2022, it’s since increased from 3% to 3.7% over the past two months. This isn’t a good sign.

Three Classic Mistakes
Please click here for a chart of Nextera Energy Partners LP (NYSE: NEP).
Note the following:

The Morning Capsule is about the big picture. The chart of NEP is being used to illustrate the point.
NEP is a publicly traded limited partnership that owns interest in wind and solar projects, and natural gas infrastructure.
NEP was formed by NextEra Energy Inc (NYSE: NEE). The largest asset of NEE is First Trust New Opprtnts MLP & Engy Fd (NYSE: FPL) which is a regulated utility that serves nearly half of Florida and is the third largest electric utility in the country.
Both NEE and NEP have been aggressively promoted to investors by Wall Street and newsletters.
Both NEE and NEP have been favorite investments of the dividend chasing crowd. Many individual investors have a large proportion of their portfolios in these stocks based on the pump on social media and other sites where the dividend chasing crowd congregates.
The anecdotal evidence is that many such investors did not even read Wall Street’s analysis.
There is also anecdotal evidence that many such investors do not even have rudimentary risk control.
The chart shows that NEP has fallen from a 52 week high of $81.32 to $24.50.
The chart shows that the drop in the stock from the high to about $48 is the first leg. This is due to rising interest rates.
The chart shows that there is a second leg showing the stock falling from about $48 to $24.50 in four trading days.
The second down leg occurred because NEP lowered its dividend growth rate due to higher interest rates making it unable to accretively add drop-downs from its parent NEE.
The stock of the parent NEE has also fallen from the high of almost $90 to about $51.
Why were investors buying NEP and NEE? They were chasing yields without understanding the business, the financials, and the impact of interest rates. The last dividend provided them with a 5.8% yield on NEP and 2.51% on NEE.
NEE and NEP are not the only stocks. The dividend chasing crowd is getting burned in many stocks.
Prudent investors need to make sure they are staying clear of the following mistakes that the dividend chasing crowd has been making. 

The crowd gets very focused on the dividends without understanding the risks. It is important to pay attention to one of the Arora Principles: give precedence to return of capital over return on ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","Cryptocurrency,Economics,Markets,Trading Ideas"

Notably, a recent Federal Reserve paper underscores the profound influence of lower interest expenses and corporate tax rates in driving over 40% of the real growth in corporate profits from 1989 to 2019.
“A scenario in which interest expense and leverage persistently weigh on ROE wouldbe a departure from the historical trend,” Goldman Sachs wrote in the note.

Volatility Ahead
Please click here for a chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The government shutdown is averted for now. The can has been kicked down the road until November 17.
Sunday evening, when futures opened, the momo crowd bought aggressively on the government not shutting down. However, as of this writing, futures have not only given up their gains but have turned negative.
The chart shows the stock market is in the top support zone. In The Arora Report analysis, the stock market is waiting for a trigger to move out of the top support zone.
In The Arora Report analysis, October is likely to test the enthusiasm for AI stocks.
October is historically the most volatile month of the year. Stock market crashes tend to happen in October. Often, October lays the groundwork for the market mechanic for year end chase to drive the stock market higher in November and December. However, keep in mind that in some years like 2022, the chase is to the downside. When investors develop in-depth knowledge of market mechanics, it gives them an edge. About two thirds of the market rise this year has been due to market mechanics. For those wanting next-level information, a podcast titled “Market Mechanics: Gain An Edge From Year End Chase” is in post-production. The podcast will be available in Arora Ambassador Club.  
The year end chase being to the upside or to the downside this year will largely depend on the following:

Upcoming earnings
Momentum in AI stocks
New economic data
Interest rates
November FOMC meeting


RSI on the chart shows that the stock market remains oversold. Oversold markets tend to bounce.

Better Inflation Data
Please click here for a chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows the stock market has bounced from the bottom band of the top support zone.

RSI on the chart shows the stock market is oversold. As we have been sharing with you, oversold markets tend to bounce.

PCE is the Fed’s favorite inflation gauge. The data came slightly better than expected.

Headline PCE came at 0.4% vs. 0.4% consensus.
Core PCE came at 0.1% vs. 0.2% consensus.


In The Arora Report analysis, core PCE is very important; however, core PCE does not include energy and food. The rising price of oil has a significant impact on lower income consumers.  For this reason, prudent investors should not disregard the rising price of oil, even though that is exactly what the market is choosing to do this morning. 
Eurozone inflation has cooled to its lowest point in two years.

Eurozone CPI came at 4.3% year-over-year vs. 4.5% consensus. CPI came at 0.3% month-over-month vs. 0.5% prior.
Eurozone core CPI came at 4.5% year-over-year vs. 4.8% consensus. Core CPI came at 0.2% month-over-month vs. 0.3% prior.

King Dollar
Please click here for a chart of the Invesco DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund (ARCA: UUP).
Note the following:

The chart shows when The Arora Report’s Morning Capsule headline read “MOMO GURUS PREDICT DEMISE OF DOLLAR BULL RUN, CHINA DATA TEMPERS ENTHUSIASM FOR STOCKS.”
Momo gurus were thrilled as the dollar had been falling going into July 17, 2023. On the morning of July 17, 2023, there was a unanimous chorus that the dollar was about to fall out of bed.  We wrote:

The chorus of momo guru predictions that the dollar bull run has ended is picking up steam again.


Momo gurus are always trying to drive the dollar lower. The reason is that momo gurus’ real job is to run up the stock market in the short term. We previously wrote:

S&P 500 companies derive significant revenue from overseas. When overseas profits are converted into dollars, the profits go up when the dollar is weaker.  For this reason, a weak dollar helps the stock market go up in the short term.


Momo gurus are not concerned about the long term. In sharp contrast, the mission of The Arora Report is to help members maximize the money they make over their lifetimes.  We previously wrote:

In the long term, a weaker dollar is not good for the U.S. A strong currency is the hallmark of a strong country.


The chart shows the power of Arora support zones and Arora calls.  

The chart shows that the Arora call coincides with the low in the dollar.
The chart shows that the Arora support zone worked as intended.  


The trendline on the chart shows that the dollar has gone straight up since July 17.
Prudent investors should note that the dollar has gone up during a period in which China and Russia put in the most intense, unprecedented efforts to drive the dollar lower. 
Russia and China are now fully aligned on the objective of China replacing the U.S. as the world’s number one superpower. China and Russia understand that a big part of the strength of the U.S. is the king dollar. The U.S. military is strong. The best way for China and Russia to dethrone the U.S. is to drive the dollar lower.
Q2 GDP - Third Estimate came 2.1% vs. 2.1% consensus.
Initial jobless claims came at 204K vs. 215K consensus.

The drivers behind the weakening risk sentiment continue to be the rise in crude oil prices, with WTI climbing to $93 per barrel, marking over a 3% gain in the session, and the increase in Treasury yields, with the 10-year reaching 4.6%.
Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari delivered hawkish remarks, asserting a significant likelihood of further interest rate hikes and indicating a lack of rate cuts in 2024.

Josey's tracking suggests ad loads expanded to 18% in July, 19% in August, and ~20% in September, and given his view that the leading SFV platform ad load is closer to mid-20%, he believes there remains upside as engagement grows and Reels' Lo-Fi ad environment ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","News,Price Target,Reiteration,Analyst Ratings,Tech,Trading Ideas"

While the S&P 500 boasts a commendable 14% year-to-date (YTD) increase, a closer look reveals the real action lies elsewhere.
In the most recent edition of his “The Flow Show” report, the analyst illustrated how the dominant force in stock market returns for 2023 has been the “Magnificent 7,” a group of technology giants that includes Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Tesla, Inc.

A Terrible Milestone Reached
Please click here for a chart of U.S. national debt.
Note the following:

The chart shows the accelerating trajectory of the U.S. national debt.
The Treasury Department is informing that for the first time, gross national debt has exceeded $33T.
The chart shows that about $10T worth of debt has accumulated since the pandemic.
The national debt is likely to exceed $50T by the end of the decade if nothing substantial is done.
We are politically agnostic. Our sole job is to help investors by being objective.
Many federal programs passed by the Biden administration are costing more than expected. Here are two examples:

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was supposed to cost about $400B over 10 years. The reality is that it may cost more than $1T. The government simply underestimated the generosity of energy tax credits in the act.
The Employee Retention Credit was supposed to cost about $55B. It has already cost $230B. Recently, the IRS froze the program to stop fraud.


Estimates are that the Federal government will be paying over $10T in interest over the next decade.
For the first 11 months of the fiscal year, the federal deficit stands at $1.5T, a 61% increase over the same period last year.
The U.S. national debt equals over $254,000 per taxpayer.
In addition to the national debt, the government has unfunded liabilities. These liabilities now total over $193T. This equates to over $577,000 per U.S. citizen.
Prudent investors are concerned and are taking into account the rising national debt in their allocation.  
Momo gurus have convinced the momo crowd that the national debt and unfunded liabilities do not matter. Momo gurus keep urging their followers to ignore the debt and buy stocks.
Today is the second day of the Fed meeting.

The Fed will announce its rate decision at 2pm ET.
Powell’s press conference is at 2:30pm ET.
The consensus is no rate hike but a hawkish statement.

Dot Plot
Please click here for the Fed’s prior dot plot.
Note the following:

The FOMC meeting is starting today. Tomorrow, the Fed will announce its decision at 2pm ET followed by Powell’s press conference at 2:30pm ET.
The dot plot shows each FOMC participants’ projected mid point of the target for the federal funds rate. Each dot represents an FOMC participant.
The chart shows that no FOMC participants projected a federal funds rate of less than 5.125% in 2023.
The chart shows that one FOMC participant projected a federal funds rate above 6% in 2023.
The chart shows wide dispersion in 2024. The highest projection is 5.875%. The lowest projection is 3.625%.
In The Arora Report analysis, there is enough uncertainty in the economic data that the high end of the projection at 5.875% and the lower end of the projection 3.625% are both possible. This is why it is important for investors to start from Arora’s Second Law of Investing and Trading. Arora’s Second Law states, “Nobody knows with certainty what is going to happen next in the markets.” It is important to not get locked into a bullish or bearish point of view. Consider flowing with the new data points. The Morning Capsules are your best source of new data points that matter. For the most part, you can ignore new data points that are not mentioned in the Morning Capsule.
The Fed is expected to release a new dot plot tomorrow.
The most important information from the Fed meeting will be the dot plot.
The consensus is that the Fed will have a hawkish statement but leave the rate unchanged.
Regarding the dot plot, momo gurus believe the dot plot will show as many as five interest rate cuts. This is the reason momo gurus are giving to urge their followers to aggressively buy stocks. The historical record is clear – momo gurus have consistently been wrong, yet being wrong does not stop momo gurus from making new projections and pretending that they know what the market will ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","Cryptocurrency,Economics,Federal Reserve,Markets,Tech"

No Fear
Please click here for a chart of volatility index VIX .
Note the following:

VIX is the fear gauge of Wall Street.
The chart shows that VIX has fallen to the lowest level in two years.
The fall in VIX is on the longest streak since 2017 – 118 consecutive days without back to back closes over 20.
The VIX has closed under the 200 day moving average for 123 days in a row. This is the first time this is happening since 2009.
$3.4 trillion notional value of options are expiring today. This is the largest September option expiration ever.
The momo crowd aggressively started buying Arm Holdings American Depositary Shares (NASDAQ: ARM) shares after the regular session close yesterday and has continued to aggressively buy ARM shares in the IPO.  Why is the momo crowd buying ARM so aggressively? The reason is that they believe that ARM is an AI play on par with NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA).  Nothing could be farther from the truth. From yesterday’s Morning Capsule:

In The Arora Report analysis, ARM is not an AI company, but facts do not matter in the stock market when investors are excited.  ARM is being marketed as an AI company, and the momo crowd does not know any better.


ARM is attempting to pivot to become an AI company. It has yet to be seen if they can succeed.  
Thank you for all of your emails requesting a podcast on ARM. We are starting work on a podcast on ARM. The podcast will be available in Arora Ambassador Club.
Wall Street is driven by fear and greed. Historically, it pays to sell when fear is sucked out of the stock market and to buy when greed is sucked out of the stock market.
In The Arora Report analysis, the lack of fear is a reason to be cautious at this time.

Slew Of New Economic Data
Please click here for a chart of VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH). This is an important chart today in view of Arm Holdings American Depositary Shares (NASDAQ: ARM) IPO.
Note the following:

The chart shows semiconductors are levitating above the support zone.
RSI on the chart shows that semiconductors are returning from an oversold condition.
ARM IPO is today. ARM designs the chips that are used by many semiconductor manufacturers and are used in practically every smartphone available today. ARM is priced at $51 per share, raising close to $5B. The IPO was 10 times oversubscribed, which will likely push the stock higher when trading begins.
In The Arora Report analysis, ARM is not an AI company, but facts do not matter in the stock market when investors are excited. ARM is being marketed as an AI company, and the momo crowd does not know any better.
How high ARM trades after it opens will be an indication of investor sentiment, especially about AI.
Semiconductors are the leading sector. How semiconductors perform after ARM IPO starts trading will also be a tell for the AI buying frenzy.
Other than the ARM IPO, there is plenty of news to keep investors excited about AI. In The Arora Report analysis, the use of generative AI is rapidly expanding but competition is also increasing. The following illustrates the point:

Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) is launching its generative AI tool to help sellers better describe their goods.
Adobe Inc (NASDAQ: ADBE) is undercutting the price of generative AI tools for images from OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT.


The European Central Bank (ECB) raised interest rates by 25 basis points. Importantly, ECB suggested it may be done raising interest rates.
In The Arora Report analysis, the indication that ECB may be done raising interest rates is bullish for the stock market.  
In The Arora Report analysis, there is a slew of new economic data that shows the economy is hotter than the consensus.  

Inflation at the producer level is hotter than the consensus.

Headline PPI came at 0.7% vs. 0.4% consensus. A big contributor is rising energy prices.
Core PPI came at 0.2% vs. 0.2% consensus, but when trade is excluded, the data is hotter.

Hotter Core Inflation
Please click here for a chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows that the stock market is in between the top support zone and mini resistance zone.
The chart shows that RSI is approaching oversold.
The chart shows that, overall, the stock market is directionless.
The newly released data shows that core inflation is running hotter than expected. Here are the details of the consumer price index.

Headline CPI came at 0.6% vs. 0.6% consensus.
Core CPI came at 0.3% vs. 0.2% consensus.


Initially, both stock and bond markets reacted negatively to the hotter than expected core inflation, but buying came in quickly as momo gurus’ new narrative took hold.  Momo gurus are often wrong. Nonetheless, you need to pay attention to them because the momo crowd blindly follows them.
Momo gurus’ new narrative has two parts.

Buy stocks because headline CPI came as expected. The flaw in this narrative is that on an annualized basis, headline CPI is at 7.2%. Momo gurus counter that the number is high because of higher oil prices and the resulting higher gas prices. Well, most people drive and spend money on gas; it is fine to exclude gas for analysis, but the reality is that rising oil prices can not simply be ignored.
The second part of the momo gurus’ new narrative is to buy stocks by looking past the hotter than expected core CPI. The reason is that they claim to know that in the future core CPI will come down. Remember, Arora’s Second Law of Investing and Trading: “Nobody knows with certainty what is going to happen next in the markets.” The reality is that nobody knows, including momo gurus, what core CPI will do in the future.

Morgan Stanley Turns Bullish On Tesla
The catalyst: Morgan Stanley’s analyst Adam Jonas shifted his stance on Tesla, moving the stock from Equalweight to Overweight. He also hiked the price target from $250 to $400, which is nearly 50% higher than current market prices. 
The reason: Tesla’s Dojo supercomputer. Morgan Stanley sees the potential of Dojo adding $500 billion to Tesla’s enterprise value. This optimism is rooted in the belief that the supercomputer will expedite adoption rates in mobility, particularly robotaxis, and network services.
Morgan Stanley emphasized the importance of identifying scalable, high-potential ventures that haven’t been fully factored in by the market. The ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","Sector ETFs,Analyst Color,Broad U.S. Equity ETFs,Specialty ETFs,New ETFs,Analyst Ratings,Tech,ETFs"

Auto Worker Strike Likely
Please click here for a chart of General Motors Co (NYSE: GM).
Note the following:

The Morning Capsule is about the big picture, not an individual stock. The chart of GM stock is being used to illustrate the point.
The chart shows that GM stock has given up all of its summer rally gains. The reason is a potential strike by United Auto Workers (UAW).
President Biden claims to be the most pro-union president. President Biden has been predicting that UAW will not strike.
In The Arora Report analysis, the probability of a UAW strike is very high.
UAW President Shawn Fain is talking about the possibility of a simultaneous strike against GM, Ford Motor Co (NYSE: F), and Stellantis NV (NYSE: STLA).
In The Arora Report analysis, if there is a simultaneous strike against all three automakers, it will put Michigan in a recession and will have a major negative impact on the U.S. economy.  
The union is especially upset that new plants such as those for batteries are not unionized.
UAW is blaming the Biden administration for giving away billions of dollars of subsidies without demanding wage standards.
All of the foregoing is positive for Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) as Tesla is not unionized.
On August 29, we shared with you:

Today, Tesla (TSLA) is turning on a massive NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA) cluster consisting of 10,000 H100 GPUs. The cluster will be used to train FSD (Full Self-Driving). Tesla is also spending $1B to build its own Dojo supercomputer.


There is heavy buying in TSLA stock in the early trade as a Wall Street bank highlights Dojo and states that Dojo can add up to $500B in value to Tesla.
The momo crowd’s pattern is to buy ahead of events, ignoring the risk. The reason is that the momo crowd believes that every event that is ahead is going to run up the stock market. In the early trade, the momo crowd is aggressively buying stocks ahead of several events.

CPI will be released on September 13 at 8:30am ET, followed by PPI on September 14 at 8:30am ET.

Wage Cut And Apple Complacency
Please click here for a chart of Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT).
Note the following:

The Morning Capsule is about the big picture, not an individual stock. The chart of Walmart stock (WMT) is being used to illustrate the point.
The trendline on the chart shows the steady move up in Walmart stock.
The chart shows Walmart stock is breaking out on the news of wage cuts.
RSI on the chart shows the stock has more room to run.
As a full disclosure Walmart stock is in the Model Portfolio of ZYX Buy by The Arora Report.
Walmart is the largest private employer in the country. For this reason, significant attention is paid to how Walmart pays its workers. The news is that Walmart is cutting starting pay for new hires with functions such as personal shopping, shelf stocking, and order picking.
In The Arora Report analysis, wage cuts in the lower income segment will likely accelerate.
In the higher income segment, employers are finding ways to layoff higher paid workers and replacing them with new hires at lower pay.
Especially hard hit are many IT workers.  Many IT workers have been told that there are no raises this year. Moreover, many IT workers who got bonuses last year are being told that there will be no bonuses this year. A large number of IT workers who were laid off last year and are insisting on matching their prior pay are still unemployed after months of searching for a job. There are reports of many workers accepting new jobs with as much as a 30% pay cut.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS) is planning another round of job cuts to cull underperformers. As many as 5% of employees may be affected. Previously, Goldman Sachs cut 3,200 employees in the first quarter, the biggest job cut since the financial crash of 2008.

Weak Seasonality
Please click here for a chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows that the stock market is below the mini resistance zone. The mini resistance zone shown on the chart is a magnet for traders.  
RSI on the chart shows that after the late August rally, momentum is waning.  
September is seasonally weak. However, bulls have a good argument – in years when S&P 500 is up more than 10% going into September, September tends to be positive. 
October is often the most volatile month of the year. Most crashes have occurred in October. 
In The Arora Report analysis, seasonality is one of the many factors that investors need to consider. The most important factor in September will be market mechanics. As of this writing, market mechanics are positive for the month, but market mechanics can quickly change.  
Understanding market mechanics can give you an edge. There are several podcasts in Arora Ambassador Club on market mechanics.  
In addition to seasonality, here are the other important factors:

The AI frenzy fever was on the verge of breaking in mid-August, but then it picked up steam again. What happens to the AI frenzy in September will come down to the news.
The consumer has been excessively spending, but low to mid income consumers are likely to start running into cash flow issues in the September/October timeframe and may start spending less.  
Economic data, especially inflation data, will be very important 
The next Fed meeting is scheduled for September 19 and 20. In The Arora Report analysis, what the Fed does will come down to the economic data that is released between now and the Fed meeting.

The new data shows that personal income is falling but personal spending is rising. How long can this continue? Since the U.S. economy is about 70% consumer based and the recession has been postponed because of strong consumer spending, investors need to pay attention to this data.

Personal income came at 0.2% vs. 0.3% consensus.

Both headline and core PCE came at 0.2% month-over-month vs. 0.2% consensus. This is the Fed’s favorite inflation gauge.

The chart shows that QQQ has moved decisively above the downward sloping trendline.
The chart shows that RSI has quickly gone from oversold to overbought.
Both of the foregoing are bullish behaviors.
In yesterday’s Afternoon Capsule, we shared with you two new negative data points for the economy. We wrote:

The chart shows when consumer confidence and the JOLTS report were released.



Consumer confidence came at 106.1 vs. 116.0 consensus.



JOLTS job openings came at 8.825M vs. 9.5M consensus.




This morning there are two new negative data points for the economy:

The ADP employment change came at 177K vs. 195K consensus.
Q2 GDP-second estimate came at 2.1% vs. 2.4% consensus.


The rise in the stock market is due to three reasons.

Excitement about AI - OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, has reached a $1B run rate.
iPhone 15 will be launched on September 12.  Apple stock historically moves up going into the launch and sells off after the launch. Since Apple is the biggest stock and has heavy weight in indexes, it has a disproportionate impact.
The new economic data points are weak.


Inflation is back in Europe.

In Spain, CPI came at 0.5% month-over-month vs. 0.4% consensus.
In Germany, flash CPI came at 0.3% month-over-month vs. 0.3% consensus. Inflation accelerated in four German states.


As an actionable item, the sum total of the foregoing is in the protection band, which strikes the optimum balance between various crosscurrents. Please scroll down to see the protection band.

Recession Probability

 Powell’s speech at Jackson Hole was about as expected.
This AI frenzy driven market was mostly focused on Nvidia earnings. Please see prior capsules. Now that Nvidia earnings are behind, the stock market is focused on momo gurus’ narrative of no recession, the recession probability is zero, and the economy is heading toward no landing.
As we have been sharing with you, lately the economic data has been very strong. A recession has clearly been postponed for two reasons.

The consumer has continued to spend aggressively. Consumer savings went up during the pandemic due to free money and other government programs. This led to excessive consumer spending. The consumer has had difficulty changing the habit of excessive spending.

Lower income households have now run down their savings and are maintaining their spending by borrowing.
Higher income households own stocks and houses. They continue to spend because they feel richer as the AI frenzy has run up the stock market and house prices have held up due to lack of supply. Since most homeowners with a mortgage have interest rates locked in below 4%, no one wants to sell their house as new mortgage rates are over 7%.


Excessive government borrowing and spending continues from the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Act. Government spending is providing more stimulus to the economy than anticipated.


Start with Arora’s Second Law of Investing and Trading. The second law states, “Nobody knows with certainty what is going to happen next in the markets.” Follow with Arora’s Third Law of Investing and Trading, which states “Making investing and trading decisions based on probabilities is the only realistic and profitable approach.”
In The Arora Report analysis, the following are the probabilities going forward:

The Liquidity Conundrum
Hartnett emphasizes the historic correlation between central bank liquidity and the performance of tech stocks over the past 15 years. However, recent events have defied this correlation, as global liquidity witnessed a contraction of a staggering $3 trillion, while the Nasdaq 100 is teetering towards new highs. The renowned analyst identifies this liquidity crunch as a potential headwind for the U.S. tech sector.

Nvidia To The Rescue
Please click here for a chart of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA).
Note the following:

The Morning Capsule is about the big picture, not an individual stock. The chart of Nvidia stock is being used because Nvidia is driving the big picture right now.
The chart shows a gap up on blowout earnings.
We previously shared with you prior to Nvidia earnings:

The consensus is $11.2B in sales for the last quarter and $12.5B for the current quarter.  The consensus is $18B per quarter starting in 2025. There will be many details in the earnings report.  However, it is the revenue number and revenue projections that will mostly determine where the stock goes and, by extension, where the entire stock market goes.


Earnings from Nvidia were one of the best we have seen in our over 30 years in the markets.

Nvidia reported revenues of $13.5B for Q2.
For the current quarter, Nvidia is guiding revenues of $16B.
Nvidia reported Q2 data center revenues of $10.32B, up 141% from Q1.
Nvidia is authorizing an additional $25B in share buyback.


Permabears are out in force saying that Nvidia is a very expensive stock.  They were saying the same thing when Nvidia reported earnings for Q1, and the stock gapped up as shown on the chart.

In The Arora Report analysis, Nvidia is growing into its valuation.  Given the current trends, our take now is very similar to our call that we published right after Q1 earnings.  The prior call from three months ago is reproduced below for your convenience.



Many investors on social media are sadly mistaken about what happened yesterday after hours. They are pointing to  a very expensive evaluation of a trailing PE of 164, a forward PE of 63, and price/sales of 26.  Yesterday’s earnings changed it all.  If the present trend continues, in The Arora Report analysis, Nvidia will likely earn $10 - $12 in 2024.  Using $11 as the mid-point and even after a 29% stock jump after hours, this translates to forward PE of 36.  For a stock that performs significantly better than perfection, a forward PE of 36 is reasonable.  As a matter of fact, The Arora Report is raising its target on Nvidia to $565 - $615, compared to the closing price of $305.38.  Nvidia is in the ZXY Buy Model Portfolio.

Positive Sentiment
Please click here for a chart of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA).
Note the following:

There is positive sentiment in the stock market in the early trade for a number of reasons explained below.
The Morning Capsule is about the big picture, not an individual stock. The chart of Nvidia stock is being used to illustrate the point.
The chart shows Nvidia's 8.47% gain on aggressive investor buying ahead of earnings that will be released tomorrow after the close. We shared with you various factors related to Nvidia in the prior Morning Capsule before most of the big rise yesterday.
The chart shows that Nvidia is up another 2.41% as of this writing in the premarket.
The chart shows the big rise in Nvidia when it reported earnings last quarter. Investors are expecting a similar rise Wednesday after the close.
The Arora Report very long term target on Nvidia was raised this morning. Other than that, there is no change in our prior call on Nvidia. We previously wrote:

In The Arora Report analysis, the demand for AI chips from Nvidia is far exceeding supply. As good as this sounds, the whisper numbers have moved up. Nvidia guided current quarter sales to $11B but whisper numbers are around $12B. A lot will also depend on what Nvidia guides for the current quarter that ends in October. Whisper numbers are around $12.5B.


Historically, it is common for a high flying stock to fall after great earnings because even great earnings often do not match high whisper numbers. To persuade their followers to buy Nvidia stock now before the earnings, momo gurus are preempting the possibility of Nvidia earnings coming below the high whisper numbers with a new mantra. The new mantra is even if Nvidia earnings are less than whisper numbers, it does not matter because the artificial intelligence frenzy will ultimately run the stock higher.
Wall Street is positioning for another leg up in the artificial intelligence frenzy rally.  Understanding positioning gives investors an edge. For those who are interested in learning about positioning, listen to the podcast titled “Market Mechanics: Positioning.”
Investors are also excited about stocks in Hong Kong rising about 2% within minutes.
In The Arora Report analysis, the 2% rise in Hong Kong stocks was most likely caused by the Chinese Plunge Protection Team (PPT) buying stocks through state entities. PPT is believed to be a secretive team inside the Chinese government with the responsibility to buy stocks to stop them from plunging.  Chinese learned from the U.S. The U.S. government is also believed to have ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","Cryptocurrency,Asia,Economics,Markets,Tech"

The topic of artificial intelligence is among the ""Big Ideas"" from Cathie Wood-led Ark Invest, but the ETF company says the days of Nvidia Corporation's (NASDAQ: NVDA) reign as the go-to AI investment may be waning.
What Happened: Shares of Nvidia are up over 200% year-to-date, as the company is seen as one of the major beneficiaries of growth in the artificial intelligence space. Wood and Ark Invest were previous investors in Nvidia, but sold their shares when they believed the valuation got too high.
Wood and Ark might be signaling Nvidia is hitting overvalued levels, calling for investors to look at small-cap companies instead.
“We believe the days of relying solely on mega-cap companies for tech innovation are waning and an era of AI-centric small-cap companies is emerging. Find out where we see potential growth opportunities built on AI,” Ark Invest tweeted Monday.
In a new report, Ark says that artificial intelligence could be a “long-term growth driver more impactful than the internet.”
The research report says that mega-cap technology stocks saw a rally on the excitement surrounding artificial intelligence possibilities, but this might be the wrong move for traders to make.
“We believe non-benchmark names are likely to accrue more value from AI over time.”

Avoiding Mega Caps: The research report said that benchmarks like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100, tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY) and Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ: QQQ), respectively, saw rallies led by artificial intelligence-linked names.

Hedge Funds Win
Please click here for a chart of iShares 20 Plus Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ: TLT).
Note the following:

The chart shows that the long bond ETF has fallen to the top band of the support zone.
Bonds trade inverse to the yield.
We have been sharing with you in the Capsules that yields at the long end are rising.
Unless you have been under a rock, you know that over the last few months there has been a chorus of asset allocators in the media singing a song of buying long term bonds. Their thesis has been that 3.5% - 4% yield on a 30 year bond was attractive, and investors needed to lock in that yield by buying long term bonds. They themselves have been buying long term bonds for their clients.
In contrast to the asset allocators, hedge funds have been aggressively short selling long bonds. As of this writing, the yield on 30 year Treasuries has risen to 4.397%. In absolute terms, the difference between 3.7% and 4.39% may not seem like much, but when you look at it for a 30 year duration, it makes a big difference. This is reflected in the chart of TLT.
At least temporarily, hedge funds have won the battle at the expense of asset allocators and their clients.
The immediate reason for rising yields at the long end has been that the momo crowd has all of a sudden discovered that the U.S. has a serious national debt problem.
At The Arora Report, we got our members out of long bonds a long time ago. Since then signals have been given as tactical trades to buy TLT a few times. You may recall that our strategic position was to buy leveraged inverse ProShares UltraShort 20+ Year Treasury (ARCA: TBT). This position was highly profitable. TBT went from a low of $15.52  in November 2021 to a high of $39.33 in October 2022. As a comparison TBT is trading at $35.52 as of this writing. The Arora Report call for the fixed income portion of the portfolio has been to keep it in short term Treasury bills.
For those who insist on a 60/40 portfolio and insist on buying bonds, so far, The Arora Report call has been spot on. Due to its importance, the following has been in every Morning Capsule for a while:

Please click here for a chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows when The Arora Report gave a signal to raise hedges.
The chart shows that so far in August, aggressive buying by the momo crowd is failing to run up the stock market.
Wall Street is finally waking up and blaming market mechanics for the sell off. 0DTE options are being singled out for the sell offs that occur late in the day.
As an Arora Report member, you knew in advance that market mechanics were changing and a sell off may ensue, at least temporarily. From the Morning Capsule from The Arora Report dated August 14:

In a separate development, for the first time in 2023, market makers are gamma hedged. This is a major development, and prudent investors should pay attention. The reason is that about two thirds of the magnitude of the stock market rally in 2023 is attributable to market mechanics. One of the market mechanics that has helped the stock market run up is short gamma squeeze. For those who want to understand this deeply, there is a new podcast titled “Market Mechanics: Impact Of Dealers’ Gamma Position Change On The Stock Market” in post production. The podcast will be available in Arora Ambassador Club. The club has several other podcasts to help you understand market mechanics in-depth.


In plain English this means that some of the fuel that led to the stock market rise this year is now spent.



It is of especially noteworthy that Wall Street knew that market mechanics were responsible, in large part, for the rally this year but never expressed that as long as the stock market was rising. Now that the stock market has pulled back slightly, they are blaming market mechanics.

Consumers Splurge
Please click here for a chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY), which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows that the stock market backed off after touching the low band of the mini resistance zone but is still significantly above the top support zone.
RSI on the chart shows that the stock market is coming out of the oversold condition.
The U.S. economy is 70% consumer based. Therefore, retail sales data carries heavy weight in the adaptive ZYX Asset Allocation Model with inputs in ten categories. In plain English, adaptiveness means that the model changes itself with market conditions. Please click here to see how this is achieved. One of the reasons behind The Arora Report’s unrivaled performance in both bull and bear markets is the adaptiveness of the model. Most models on Wall Street are static. They work for a while and then stop working when market conditions change. The U.S. consumer continues to splurge. Here are the details from the data just released:

July retail sales came at 0.7% vs. 0.4% consensus.
July retail sales ex-auto came at 1.0% vs. 0.4% consensus.


In The Arora Report analysis, strong retail sales data is a double edged sword. On one hand, consumer splurging is postponing the recession. On the other hand, it will force the Fed’s hand to maintain high interest rates for longer.  
In spite of strong retail sales, sentiment is taking a hit this morning because of two developments.

The rating agency Fitch is warning that it may downgrade credit ratings of several U.S. banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE: JPM). Previously, Moody’s downgraded ten banks including U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB) and Truist Financial Corp (NYSE: TFC).
Economic data from China is weak. Here are the details:

July retail sales came at 2.5% year-over-year vs. 4.5% consensus.
Industrial production came at 3.7% year-over-year vs. 4.4% consensus.

The Trade Desk reported 2Q results ahead of expectations, while its 3Q guide was slightly above expectations. While the adtech earnings cycle has been uneven in 2Q, TTD again rose above the fray to post solid results, gaining market share and consolidating its position in CTV. 
TTD again highlighted its progress in CTV and Retail Media, with CTV growing the fastest among scaled channels and spurring international growth. At the same time, Retail Media remains very promising in the early days.
Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein maintained an Outperform and raised the price target from $80 to $95.
The re-rating reflects a slightly higher target multiple and slightly lower discount rate. The company is highly excited about improving advertiser sentiment, with early success in OpenPath displacing ineffective SSPs, allowing more efficient buying. 
CTV, Shopper Marketing, and UID 2.0 flywheel continue to drive spend. The 2Q beat reflects advertisers' increasing focus on full-funnel ROI. 
The 3Q revenue guide implies slight acceleration. With best-in-class DSP and exposure to the fastest-growing parts of digital advertising (CTV and retail media), valuation is probably investors' only genuine concern.

Consumer Price Index Ahead
Please click here for a chart of Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL).
Note the following:

The Morning Capsule is about the big picture, not an individual stock. The chart of AAPL stock is being used to illustrate the point.
The chart shows AAPL stock bounced from the top band of the support zone. The Arora Report has an unrivaled record of providing support zones, resistance zones, buy zones, and target zones over a long period of time.
We previously wrote:

Apple stock is the largest stock in the market, has heavy weight in indexes, and is the most beloved stock perceived by many as a safe stock. For this reason, whatever happens to Apple stock has a disproportionate impact on the entire stock market.


The all important Consumer Price Index (CPI) data is ahead. CPI will be released Thursday at 8:30am ET.  The consensus is 0.2% for both core and headline CPI.
Producer Price Index (PPI) will be released on Friday at 8:30am ET. The consensus is 0.2% for both core and headline PPI.
The Fed released its latest Household Debt and Credit report. Here are the key points:

Household debt hit $17T in the latest report. $2.9T of that debt has accumulated from the end of 2019.
Credit card debt hit a record $1.03T, increasing 4.6% quarter-over-quarter.
Auto loans also increased, following the trend.
Student loan balances decreased to $1.57T.
Mortgage balances and home equity credit lines were stable.


Especially important for prudent investors is the question about a potential recession. In The Arora Report analysis, a recession has been postponed to 2024. The main reasons are AI frenzy in the stock market, excessive consumer spending, leftover funds in consumers’ pockets from pandemic government programs, and Bidenomics. The fact that credit card debt has reached a record shows that one source of spending is borrowing. This cannot last forever.  
As an actionable item, the sum total of the foregoing is in the protection band, which strikes the optimum balance between various crosscurrents. Please scroll down to see the protection band.

Long Yields Rise
Please click here for a chart of iShares 20 Plus Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ: TLT).
Note the following:

The chart shows that long bonds are falling because yields on long bonds are rising. Bonds trade inverse to the yield.
The trendline on the chart shows that TLT had been making lower highs prior to the sudden drop.
The chart shows that TLT has now fallen below the prior support zone, which has now become the resistance zone.
The chart shows the next support zone.
RSI on the chart shows that TLT is way oversold. An oversold condition can lead to a quick bounce, but the bounce may not be sustainable in view of the huge supply of Treasury bonds. As a member of The Arora Report, you knew in advance that this was likely to happen due to increased borrowing by the U.S. We previously wrote:

In The Arora Report analysis, here is an important piece of new data that prudent investors should pay attention to. The U.S. Treasury Department has announced that it plans to borrow about $1T in the third quarter. This is the largest amount ever to be borrowed by the U.S. in any third quarter. More importantly, the amount to be borrowed is about $200B more than the prior estimates.


Along with the rise in yields on U.S. government bonds, yields on government bonds across the globe are rising.
Traditionally when yields rise, stocks fall. The reason is that stocks compete with bonds. When yields rise, bonds become more attractive.
Since technology stocks tend to be long duration stocks, historically, they are impacted negatively more than other stocks by rising yields. To develop an in-depth understanding of how it all works, listen to the podcast titled “Be Careful With Popular Long Duration Stocks.” In addition to this podcast, there are several other podcasts in Arora Ambassador Club that give you in-depth knowledge on the subject.
Rising yields were responsible for the significant drop in technology stocks and the bear market in 2022.
In 2023, investor exuberance over AI became so great that investors stopped caring about the yields. As a result, the historical relationship between stocks and bonds broke. Will the historical relationship reassert itself?
Here are the key points from Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) earnings:

Apple earnings were slightly below the consensus and significantly below the whisper numbers.
Apple revenues declined for the third quarter in a row.
Apple is on track for declining revenues in this quarter. This will make the worst revenue decline streak for Apple in two decades.

The re-rating reflected higher estimates post a beat and raised 2Q23 report. 
The price target represents a ~20% premium to the three-year historical NTM average multiple, which he views as warranted provided the company's expanding opportunity with both Cloud Titans, CSPs and Enterprise, including AI-related expansion long-term to Arista's addressable markets. 
Further, the analyst continues to view Enterprise as Arista's incremental growth engine, which he believes could rival the Cloud Titan segment in C2H23 in terms of percentage of revenue. 
The additive growth opportunities focused on Enterprise deserve a higher multiple, all else equal, provided a more diverse and dynamic addressable market going forward.

The company reported quarterly sales of $133.74 million, which beat the consensus of $133.33 million.
DoubleVerify agreed to acquire Scibids Technology sas in cash and stock transaction valued at $125 million, with additional potential consideration based on certain performance metrics. Scibids builds AI that automates and optimizes an advertiser's programmatic buying of digital ad campaigns.
Several analysts reacted to the company's performance and acquisition.
KeyBanc analyst Justin Patterson maintained an Overweight rating on DoubleVerify with a $45 price target.
The 2Q revenue of $134 million (+22% Y/Y) bracketed Patterson's and Street's estimates of $135 million and $133 million. EBITDA of $40 million was above Patterson and Street estimates of $38 million.
He suspects results and guidance would have been more robust without MediaMath's bankruptcy, creating some near-term noise.
Given that shares were at a 52-week high heading into the print, Patterson suspects the lack of a beat and raise and acquisition will spark bear concerns about 2024 growth rates. 
Operationally, he saw nothing thesis-changing, and his 2023/2024/2025 EBITDA forecasts are essentially unchanged. 
Stifel analyst Mark Kelley reiterated a Buy rating with a price target of $44.
DV reported a marginally better 2Q, and the 3Q guide was ~in-line (left FY23 unchanged).

The Fed raised interest rates to the highest in 21 years yesterday.


FOMC officials voted unanimously to hike by 25bps to 5.25-5.50.


The move surprised exactly no one.


At the presser, Powell stressed upcoming meetings would be “live” (i..e, no decisions have been made).


He suggested that target inflation (2%) wouldn’t be reached until at least 2025.


He also noted that staff are no longer predicting a recession as their base case.

Strong Economic Data
Please click here for a chart of Global X Dow 30 Covered Call ETF (ARCA: DJIA)
Note the following:

The chart shows that DJIA has shown a winning streak for 13 consecutive days. DJIA is higher this morning in the premarket. If the trend continues, today may be the 14th consecutive high in DJIA.
The chart compares DJIA to SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA: SPY) and Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ: QQQ).
The chart shows that DJIA is leading the other two leading indexes during this winning streak.
Previously, DJIA had been lagging because it does not contain all of the magnificent seven stocks that have led the rally. The magnificent seven stocks are Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ: GOOG), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: META), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA), and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA).
It is said that history does not repeat itself, but it rhymes. In many ways, the DJIA winning streak is similar to pre-crash streaks of the past.

DJIA had a 13 day winning streak in January 1987. In October 1987, the stock market crashed, losing 22% in one day.
There are similarities to July 1929 when DJIA had a winning streak of 11 days. Subsequently, the stock market experienced the famous 1929 crash.
It is important to note that neither the 1929 nor 1987 streak resulted in a crash immediately.


The economic data released this morning is very strong. Here are the details:

Q2 GDP-Adv came at 2.4% vs. 1.6% consensus.
Q2 GDP Deflator-Adv came at 2.2% vs. 3.0% consensus.

“The recent market strength is being driven by FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) by both retail and institutional investors,” he said.
“We do not think the daily grind upward in the stock indexes is sustainable, largely amid the possibility of mixed earnings reports over the next few weeks and the possibility of yet another Fed rate hike. Rather than chase stocks at these levels, investors would be wise to be patient at this point and use any corrections as a buying opportunity,” he said.

The analyst re-rated ahead of SNAP's 2Q earnings on July 25, still lacking revenue growth catalysts, including limited tangibles concerning its DR stack rebuild. 
The stock's ~25% appreciation since its 1Q earnings release reflects a valuation realignment with ad tech's rebound on assumed 2H advertising stability, which the analyst doubts. 
Net-net, SNAP's DR stack progression, and ultimate competitiveness remain elusive with his discussions in the industry and suggest an elongated return to revenue growth. 
Further, TikTok is becoming more aggressive with new DR offerings, siphoning more near-term market share from SNAP and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: META). 
And without revenue catalysts, the analyst believes management's loosened reins on FCF production (traded for product investment) may be walking the stock on a tightrope, which he hopes to gain greater clarity on from the call.

The analyst is incrementally positive on Meta, tweaked estimates, and raised his price target ahead of the 2Q23 print on July 26. It reflects a continued recovery in ad spending in 2Q and expectations for further acceleration in 2H23. 
Resilience in user engagement and early signs of success with Reels bode well for META amid favorable macro indicators, including consumer spending, unemployment, and inflation. 
Management's focus on operating efficiencies should improve margins even as META invests in priority areas like AI/ML. Squali views Threads' traction as impressive, but much work remains for it to become consequential for META. 
The 2Q results will likely show sequential improvement in resilient consumption & easier Y/Y comps. 
The analyst expects $31.2 billion in revenue in 2Q vs. $30.8 billion previously, within management's guidance of $29.5 billion - 32 billion and virtually in line with the Street consensus of $31.0 billion.

An increasing share of global fund managers sees it as the most likely outcome over the next 12 months:

Macro
Here are some highlights from BofA’s latest Global Fund Manager Survey:


Investors still expect global growth to weaken in the next 12 months.


But only 48% predict a recession by the end of Q1 2024.


In fact, most (68%) see a soft landing as the most likely outcome over the next year.


Sentiment, however, is still stubbornly low.


Investors expect the Fed’s first cut will come in Q2 2024.



June’s retail sales report revealed mixed signals about consumer strength.


Headline sales missed expectations, rising by 0.2% (vs. 0.5% expected) MoM to 1.5% YoY (vs. 1.6% expected).


On the other hand, spending on the core/control group–which excludes food, autos, gas, and building materials and is used to calculate GDP–jumped by 0.6%.


Overall, consumer spending softened but flashed resilience in June amid higher prices and borrowing costs.



Homebuilder confidence rose for the 7th consecutive month in July.


The NAHB Housing Market Index is at its highest since June 2022.


With record-low inventories boosting demand, why wouldn’t it be?


According to Redfin, the total number of homes for sale dropped 15% YoY in June to an all-time low (chart).


At the same time, home prices may have bottomed: June’s median sale price decline was the smallest of the past 5 months (chart) and homes are beginning to sell above their list prices.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) shares reached fresh all-time highs after the company announced new generative AI subscriptions for Microsoft 365.


The (not cheap) $30-a-month add-on includes AI tools that work with Teams, Word, and Excel.


Separately, Microsoft also announced a new partnership with Meta (NASDAQ: META).

A measure of the U.S. dollar plummeted to levels unseen since mid-April 2022, while Treasury yields continued to soften as market bets on two Fed rate hikes this year collapsed. 
Tech was the top performing sector, with all seven S&P 500 heavyweights in the green, led by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which gained 4.5%. Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) jumped 2.6% to a 43-week high after reporting record sales during its Prime Day event.
Cues From The Thursday’s Session: 
The S&P 500 Index rose 0.5% breaking above 4,500, the highest level since the last week of April 2022. The Nasdaq 100 Index gained 1.3% surging to mid-January 2022 levels. 
Blue-chip stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged 0.2% higher, while small caps in the Russell 2000 Index gained 0.9%.

Please click here for a chart of Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (ARCA: XLI).
Note the following:

As the momo crowd in the stock market feels the nirvana of cooling inflation, no recession belief, and expanding breadth of the rally, import data strongly contradicts the bullish beliefs.  However, right now, the momo crowd is oblivious and buying stocks. Prudent investors are paying attention to the import data.
The chart shows that industrials have broken out. Industrials are very sensitive to the economy and get hurt in a recession.
The fact that industrials have broken out shows that the predominant belief of stock market investors is that there will be no recession.
The data from China directly contradicts the conclusion of stock market bulls in the U.S. that there will be no recession.

The U.S. is a major importer of Chinese goods. In the case of many goods, there are no reasonable alternatives to China.
Chinese exports to the U.S. dropped about 24%. This is the worst number since March 2020.
The data from China shows that consumers’ buying of goods in the U.S. is definitely slowing.


Producer Price Index (PPI) came cooler than expected. Here are the details:

Headline PPI came at 0.1% vs. 0.2% consensus.
Core PPI came at 0.1% vs. 0.2% consensus.


Jobless claims came at 237K vs. 247K consensus. This is a leading indicator and carries heavy weight in the adaptive ZYX Asset Allocation Model with inputs in ten categories. The model has a great track record in both bull and bear markets.

In its latest “Research Investment Committee (RIC) report,” BofA names three ETFs to invest in if AI proves to be a disruptive technology, as well as 10 single stocks to buy if AI only moderately increases productivity.
According to a recent PwC study, artificial intelligence could benefit the world economy by up to $15.7 trillion by 2030, while IDC predicts the global AI market will reach $900 billion by 2026. 
Productivity growth is crucial for improving living standards, Bank of America said. The most recent substantial rise in productivity occurred in the late 1990s, when computers permeated the economy, resulting in an average annual productivity growth of 3.2% from 1996 to 2004.

Investors who believe that AI will spark an economy-wide productivity boom should consider owning AI ETFs because “it’s hard to pick the ultimate winners and losers of a technological revolution,” Bank of America analysts said in a Tuesday note.

Delays associated with AMD's MI300 are likely to free up incremental capacity in the second half of FY23. At the same time, he believes NVDA has secured enough capacity (CoWoS) to quadruple its data center revenues in 2024. Therefore, the analyst raised his estimates and price target.

China’s Producer Deflation
Please click here for a chart of Xtrackers Hvst CSI 300 China A-Shs ETF (ARCA: ASHR).
Note the following:

The chart shows that unlike the U.S., the Chinese market has not staged a significant rally this year. China is important because it is the second largest economy in the world.
The stock market rally in the U.S. is driven by the AI frenzy that has caused money to flow into seven magnificent stocks. The magnificent seven stocks are Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ: GOOG), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: META), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA), and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA).
China is the biggest competitor to the U.S. in artificial intelligence.
The chart shows that the AI rally in Chinese stocks has fizzled.
China is close to deflation. Consumer Price Index (CPI) in China is important for the Chinese domestic economy, but Producer Price Index (PPI) in China is important for the rest of the world, including the U.S. For this reason, investors should pay attention to PPI in China. Here is the data:

China’s CPI came at 0.0% year-over-year vs. 0.2% consensus.
PPI in China came at -5.4% year-over-year vs. -5% consensus.
PPI in China has now fallen for nine consecutive months.


China is the factory to the world. As producer prices in China fall, prices of exports from China also fall. This is helping reduce goods inflation in the U.S. and making overall inflation numbers look good.
As we have written before, in The Arora Report analysis, it is the core services inflation ex-housing that is important for investors. This includes items such as cost of travel, restaurants, and haircuts. The Fed is also focused on core services inflation.
In The Arora Report analysis to counter deflation, the Chinese government is likely to provide stimulus. Investors love stimulus as stimulus creates more money. A part ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","Asia,Economics,Markets,Tech"

Since Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: META) launched its new social media platform, Threads, on July 6, it has been the talk of the town. But one question that’s on everyone’s mind is whether it will actually be the Twitter killer it has been set up to be.
Zuckerberg took to the new platform to announce that Threads had seen 30 million sign-ups so far. For a platform that’s only one day old, that’s an impressive feat but it still pales in comparison to Twitter’s more than 400 million users.
That said, the number of global monthly users on Twitter is predicted to fall by around 32 million users over the next couple of years after Tesla chief Elon Musk took over, according to market research agency Insider Intelligence. Musk has made sweeping changes at the social media platform since he took charge, ruffling a few feathers along the way.

What Happened: Seen as Meta Platforms’ answer to social media platform Twitter, Threads is a text-based social media platform widely publicized as a potential Twitter killer and as a spark that potentially led to the proposed cage fight between Twitter owner Elon Musk and Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg.
Launched Wednesday night, Threads has seen strong interest from users and was a trending topic on Twitter.
Users can download the app on their phones or visit threads.net to get directed to the proper download page. Users who visit threads.com are greeted by a different company.
“Threads is a Slack replacement design for makers,” according to Threads. The company provides ways for companies to share their work and connect teams.
Slack is a business messaging app acquired by Salesforce Inc (NYSE: CRM) in July 2021.
Privately held Threads was founded in 2017 by Jon McCord, Mark Rich, Rousseau Kazi and Suman Venkataswamy. Three of the four co-founders have previous work history at Facebook.
Rich was a data scientist for Facebook from 2013 to 2017; Kazi worked at Facebook for six years including serving as the manager of product; and McCord was a software engineer at Facebook for almost five years.

The release of a healthy ADP employment number raised investor expectations that the Federal Reserve may resume interest rate hikes and perhaps extend them beyond the summer. With 497,000 new jobs added in June, above May’s result of 267,000 and predictions of 228,000, concerns are growing that the Fed will become more hawkish.
In reaction, traders revised their estimates for future Fed rate hikes, assigning an almost certain probability to a July boost and a roughly 50-50 chance of another hike by November.
Furthermore, the most recent FOMC minutes revealed an unusual level of dissent among participants, increasing concerns that more hawkish members may acquire power over the board.
As investors await Friday’s job market report, which will reveal June nonfarm payrolls (expected to be around 225,000) and the unemployment rate (expected to be 3.6%), many expect the data will confirm stronger-than-expected job market performance, following the impressive ADP National Employment Report.
Cues From Thursday’s Trading:
All major U.S. averages were trading in the negative, with the S&P 500 Index and the Nasdaq 100 Index both down 1.1%.
The Dow Jones slightly underperformed, down 1.3%, while small caps in the Russell 2000 index were the weakest link, plummeting 2.2% for the session.

Contrary to the prevailing bullish sentiment, Hartnett believes that this is not a new ‘shiny bull market’, and that a big rally might be the precursor to a big collapse akin to a combination of the dot-com bubble in 2000 and the financial crisis in 2008.
Hartnett has been quite pessimistic on the market so far this year, arguing that investors should be cautious in light of persistently strong inflation and the possibility of future interest rate hikes. But the market has proven him wrong so far, with the S&P 500 index up 15% and the Nasdaq 100 index up 37.6%  this year.

Here are five key takeaways for investors ahead of the report and analyst reactions to past releases. 
What Investors Need To Know
Economists expect retail sales to rebound 0.7% month over month in April, after falling 0.6% in March.

In annual terms, retail sales jumped 2.3% in March — the smallest surge since May 2020. 
Core retail sales (excluding automobiles) will likely increase 0.4% in April, rebounding from a 0.4% drop in March.
Retail sales fell for the second consecutive month in March
Increasing interest rates and cost concerns are weighing on consumers' propensity to spend.
If retail sales fall in April, it would mark the third consecutive month of reductions. The last time three consecutive negative retail sales reports occurred was from August to October in 2015.

The CPI data is one of the most crucial market-moving events for stocks, as investors try to decipher the state of the economy and how the Federal Reserve could respond next. 
How Is The Market Positioned Ahead Of April CPI? The consensus expectation from analysts is for the U.S. CPI inflation rate to hold at 5% annually in April, unchanged from March, while core inflation is predicted to slightly ease from 5.6% to 5.5%. The monthly increase for both headline and core inflation is expected to be at 0.4%.
Fed future swaps indicate investors currently assign an 88% probability of the Fed holding interest rates steady at 5-5.25% in June, as opposed to a 12% chance of a further 0.25% hike.

The main underperformers of the day are U.S. Treasuries, with yields jumping dramatically across all maturities of the curve as investors perceive First Republic's resolution as lowering the risks of a banking meltdown.

Analyst Color: Despite worries concerning a potential recession, companies have shown profit growth. “The most important consideration is that while recession fears are still very much discussed, there is no earnings recession in the cards yet,” said fund manager Louis Navellier. 
He also noted that food companies are increasing prices, which could turn out to be negative for inflation expectations. The stalemate over raising the debt ceiling also kept traders on the sidelines, he noted. Since then, the House has passed a bill to raise the ceiling, but it remains to be seen whether President Joe Biden will approve the legislation, given his disagreement over the spending cuts that were included as part of the bill.

Rock made a joke about Pinkett Smith’s shaved head and husband Smith walked on the stage to slap the comedian.
“Keep my wife’s name out your f**king mouth,” Smith shouted from his seat after the slap. 
Rock said it was a “G.I. Jane” joke, but Smith took offense to the joke as his wife has alopecia, which causes hair loss.

Speaker Kevin McCarthy passed his debt limit bill through the House yesterday…barely.


The vote was 217-215 in favor, with all Democrats (and four Republicans) opposing the measures.


The bill now heads to the Democratic-controlled Senate where it has virtually no chance of passing.



Federal prosecutors believe Jack Teixeira—the Massachusetts guardsman charged with leaking highly-classified intelligence documents—may still have access to sensitive material.


He is accused of attempting to cover up his tracks by destroying computer equipment, urging others to delete messages, and instructing them not to talk to investigators.


Authorities also say they found a cache of weapons at two homes used by Teixeira, which included handguns, rifles, shotguns, an AK-style high-capacity weapon, and a literal bazooka.



Orders for US durable goods jumped by 3.2% in March, easily topping market expectations of a 0.7% increase.


Much of that gain, however, is attributable to a surge in new contracts for passenger planes.


Stripping out transportation, core goods rose by just 0.3% in March and posted the slowest annual gain in over 3 years.


Meanwhile, business investment (red) fell for the 4th time in 5 months and points to a slowing economy.

The analyst noted that the recent run has left the S&P 500 Index at the top-end of the trading range following its emergence from the October low.

Analyst Color: 
The Fed could stay on course despite the economic slowdown and raise rates at the upcoming May 2-3 meeting, according to Jeffrey Roach, the chief economist at LPL Financial.

He does not rule out the possibility of a rate cut by the end of the year if the economy becomes more unstable.

Two years ago, the probability of these two public figures owning competing social media platform — Truth Social and Twitter — would have sounded as unlikely as Trump’s political potential back in 2015.
With the confirmation of Trump’s presidential bid for the 2024 election, their relationship takes a new shape: one that has the ability to influence the economic and political landscape in the coming years.
Last month, Musk said that if Trump were to be indicted, he'll ""be re-elected in a landslide victory.” Trump's indictment became a reality soon after.

Friends Or Foes?
Musk announced in the past that he would welcome Trump back to Twitter, after the former reality TV show star's account had been suspended, on account of his posts that were flagged for inciting violence before, during, and after the Jan. 6 atack on the U.S. Capitol. Trump was also kicked off Facebook and Instagram, both owned by Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META)
Trump’s Twitter reinstatement sprouted off Musk’s ideas around free speech, which became the basis for his acquisition of the social media platform in late October.

Analyst Color: 
The market appears to be telling that we will get through the banking crisis, said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network.
“With all the turmoil and headlines, the system is working as it should to contain the damage,” he said.
The analyst noted that banks on the whole are well-capitalized and the government has the tools and will to solve problems. “Keep calm and carry on,” he added.
Bank of America investment strategist Michael Hartnett expressed a bearish view on the stock market, forecasting further declines in the next three to six months. In the 1970s and 1980s, the Dow Jones showed negative returns after the last Fed hike. Tighter bank lending will erode the lifeblood of companies, culminating in job and profit losses, he added.

Analyst Color: 
Bears came out of hibernation last week after waking up to a warning shot from the banking space, said Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial.
“Technical damage was widespread as the S&P 500 violated its closely watched 200-day moving average, along with an uptrend that has been in place since October,” the analyst said. As of Friday afternoon, less than half of the S&P 500 stocks were above their 200-day moving averages compared to February’s high of 79%, he noted.
Turnquist sees the next major support area at the December lows near 3,783. A break below the level would significantly raise the odds for a retest of the October lows, he added.

The first six weeks of 2023 have shown mixed signals, with the Dow Industrials and the S&P 500 Index underperforming the riskier Nasdaq Composite and the Russell 2000 Index, fund manager Louis Navellier said in a note. The risk premium on junk bonds has dropped to the lowest since the second quarter of 2022 and the 10-year Treasury note yield, though rising, was still below 4%, he added.
The analyst also highlighted the breadth of the rally, by pointing out that the S&P Equal-Weighted’s total return has outpaced the overall S&P 500 Index.

Here’s a look at his current wealth and how his loss compares to several other notable billionaires in recent history.

Adani Group firms had also taken on significant debt, using shares of stock for loans, according to the report.
Following the short report, the Adani Group’s flagship company Adani Enterprises called off a planned $2.5 billion share sale. The company cited protecting the interest of investors and said the company’s balance sheet is healthy.
Investor Bill Ackman, who praised the short report from Hindenburg Research, said he would not be surprised if the planned offering was “rigged with affiliate buyers.”
Adani began 2023 with a wealth of $120.5 billion, ranking him in the top five wealthiest billionaires.
Since the short report came out and shares of several Adani-linked companies have fallen, ...","News,Education,Movers & Shakers,Management,Global,General"

Brady previously announced his retirement from the league in February 2022 before deciding one month later that he would return.
Brady said in his retirement video on social media on Wednesday that this time he is stepping away from playing ""for good."" 
Brady was the oldest player in the NFL for the 2022-2023 season. Drafted 199th overall in the 2000 NFL Draft on April 6, 2000, a lot has changed since Brady first entered the league.
Here’s a look at 23 things that weren’t around when Brady joined the NFL.
Cryptocurrency: Leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) was founded in 2009, following a white paper released the previous year. The market capitalization of Bitcoin is more than $400 billion and one of many cryptocurrencies that are now readily available to trade by consumers, including on the FTX app endorsed by Brady.
Twitter: Social media platform Twitter Inc was founded in March 2006. Brady has 2.8 million followers on the social media platform as of today.
Facebook: Social media platform Facebook, which is owned by Meta Platforms inc (NASDAQ: META), was founded in 2004, two years after Brady joined the NFL.
Instagram: Photo and video sharing social media platform Instagram, which is owned by Meta Platforms, launched in 2010. Brady has more than 13 million followers on Instagram, but trails his ex-wife, model Gisele Bundchen at 20.5 million.
iPhone: Now one of the most popular smartphones in the world, the iPhone wasn’t launched until 2007 by Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL). Brady couldn’t own an iPhone until his eighth season in the NFL.
Netflix Streaming: Now used by hundreds of millions of people worldwide, the ability to stream movies and television shows from Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX) wasn’t a reality when Brady joined the league. Netflix launched in 1998 as a DVD by mail service and would later add streaming in 2007.

Cues From Tuesday’s Trading: 
Stocks closed notably higher on Tuesday, capping off a strong January, as positive reactions to earnings from companies, including General Motors Corp. (NYSE: GM) and Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM), lifted the market mood. Ahead of Wednesday’s rate decision, traders also took heart from a Labor Department report showing a smaller-than-expected increase in compensation in the fourth quarter.

The major averages opened modestly higher and climbed steadily until late trading when a late-session buying surge increased the tempo of the rally. The S&P 500 Index settled at a two-month high and the Dow Industrials ended at its highest level since mid-January.
Material, consumer discretionary and real estate led the gains on a day the market witnessed a broad-based rally.

Analysts have been cautious this time around after much of their 2022 forecasts fell flat in the wake of the unprecedented headwinds that rocked the economy and the market.
The Year That Was For Equity Market:  The equity market peaked very early in 2022, with most stocks hitting their 52-week highs in January. Thereafter, it was the case of a broader downtrend interspersed by bear-market rallies. Even the technical Santa Claus rally that many had hoped eluded Wall Street.

The tech sector led the sell-off from the front, as evidenced by the steeper 33.1% plunge by the Nasdaq Composite Index. The Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ: QQQ), an exchange-traded fund that tracks non-financial tech companies, shed 32.6%.

This week, S3 Partners released an updated report on the most profitable stocks of the year for short sellers, and Tesla leads the way by leaps and bounds.
S3 estimates Tesla short sellers had generated $15 billion in profits in 2022 through Dec. 21, which does not include Tesla's nearly 9% decline on Thursday.
Tesla's stock price is down 69.5% year-to-date in 2022, and the selling pressure has intensified in the last two months as investors fear financial fallout from Tesla CEO Elon Musk's chaotic $44-billion takeover of Twitter and a potential slowdown in EV demand.

One of the biggest news stories of 2023 could be who becomes the next Twitter CEO.
Here’s a look at how some betting odds for the position and some hypothetical odds are shaping up.
What Happened: Social media platform Twitter was acquired by Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk for $44 billion.
Musk made several changes for Twitter since taking over including job cuts, ramping up monetization efforts and unsuspending and suspending several accounts.
Musk ran a poll asking his followers if he should step down as the CEO of Twitter. The majority (57.5%) of the more than 17.5 million people who voted in the poll said yes, Musk should step down.
“I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job! After that, I will just run the software & servers teams,” Musk tweeted, as Benzinga previously reported.
The race to become CEO of Twitter has seen many candidates mentioned due to their ties to Musk and also has seen some interesting names such as Edward Snowden and Tom from MySpace volunteer for the job title.
Here’s a look at some betting odds for a potential successor to Musk in the role of Twitter CEO.

On Friday, in a Twitter post, Musk announced that he would reveal all the details about the suppression of the Hunter Biden story. He followed up by posting a series of Twitter threads from journalist Matt Taibbi. 
What really happened with the Hunter Biden story suppression by Twitter will be published on Twitter at 5pm ET!

In a lengthy tweet thread, Taibbi said he received ""thousands of internal documents"" from sources at Twitter and detailed what transpired behind the scenes at the company during the incident.
In his tweets, Taibbi included screenshots of emails of requests from unidentified people in President Joe Biden's administration, asking contacts at Twitter to take action against specific tweets.

With the Federal Reserve signaling its intention to potentially pivot, each incoming data is likely to trigger volatility in the market.
On Thursday, the major U.S. averages closed on a mixed note, as traders reacted to economic reports showing a slight letup in inflationary pressure and weakening economic activity. Some of the weakness may be traced back to profit-taking following Wednesday’s strong rally, which took the S&P 500 Index and the Nasdaq Composite indices to their highest level since mid-September.
Financial and real estate stocks were among the worst-hit sectors on Thursday, while tech stocks gained ground.

Here's the latest:

Since Elon Musk took the helm at Twitter, about half the company’s workforce was laid off.
Twitter founder Jack Dorsey took part of the blame for overgrowing the company at times of financial tailwinds.
Meta (NASDAQ: META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg shared a similar sentiment in a letter where he announced the firing of 11,000 employees — 13% of the company’s global staff.
Earlier this month, Lyft (NASDAQ: LYFT) decided to remove 13% of employees from its payroll.
Digital payments giant Stripe cut 14% of its workforce.
In August, ​​1,300 of a total of 6,400 Snapchat (NYSE: SNAP) employees were shown the door.
In July, Shopify shut down 10% of its workforce.
Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is expected to let go over 10,000 employees (it froze new hires at least until 2023)
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is also reportedly on a hiring freeze.

These are just a few examples of a trend that is reaching far more than the best-known names in tech. Layoffs.fiy, a site that has been tracking layoffs in the tech industry since the start of the pandemic, has registered 136,989 layoffs from 849 companies in 2022 alone.
Indeed, the press and public opinion made the topic a central narrative for the second half of 2022, but hard data shows that the issue is sector-specific, and the U.S. job market remains strong.

The decision came after a poll was conducted by Musk on Twitter, which had been among the biggest topics of the weekend and Monday.
“Smart marketing move for Twitter. Now everyone comes to see what Trump does. Awful for Trump. The pressure is on him to entertain. Tweets hit different as the President vs now being TFG,” Mark Cuban tweeted, referencing Trump being ""the former guy.""
A Twitter user asked Cuban that if the business of Twitter was attracting advertisers, why would it bring Trump back to the platform?

Many began following Trump's account and are likely wondering why he hasn’t posted yet. An SEC filing might share some clues.
What Happened: Trump was banned in January 2021 from several social media platforms, including Twitter, due to the role he played in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.
Trump was reinstated to Twitter over the weekend, thanks to a move made by Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, who acquired Twitter for $44 billion. 
Trump had already amassed more than 80 million followers on Twitter, significantly more than he has on the social media platform Truth Social, which belongs to his own company, Trump Media & Technology Group.
Investors in Digital World Acquisition Corp (NASDAQ: DWAC), a SPAC with a pending merger with Trump Media & Technology Group, are likely concerned that Trump coming back to Twitter could hurt his own platform.

Monday’s economic calendar is light and doesn’t boast of any major market-moving data or reports. Traders could show apprehension ahead of the Nov. 8 midterm elections and the consumer price inflation report due on Thursday.
Stocks closed the week ended Nov. 5 on a downbeat note, with technology stocks serving as drags on the overall market. The weekly losses reflected trader reaction to the Federal Reserve’s 75 basis point rate hike as well as hawkish commentary by Chair Jerome Powell at the press conference, mixed earnings news flow and the strong October jobs data. Nevertheless, stocks ended the week on a firmer footing.

TikTok recently announced the expansion of its universe with the inclusion of an exclusive section for video games.
The app that revolutionized the mobile video market now aims to repeat its success in the field of mobile games, albeit without neglecting its main offering.
ByteDance, the company that owns the platform, has not yet confirmed when the video game catalog will be available on the social network. As reported by the Financial Times, the official announcement should arrive in the next week.
According to the British media outlet, these games would be integrated into the existing TikTok app, so users would not have to download an additional component to access this functionality. Instead, a new exclusive tab would be added to the app.
We’re ONE WEEK OUT from #TikTokMadeMePlayIt, our first virtual gaming event for publishers.

(NASDAQ: SNAP) is scheduled to report third-quarter earnings on Thursday after the market closes. The company is coming off two tough quarters and the resultant sharp pullback in shares.
Snap’s earnings could give a foretaste of what to expect from ad-dependent social media platforms such as Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META), Twitter Inc. (NYSE: TWTR), Pinterest Inc. (NYSE: PIN) and potentially Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG).
Key Metrics To Watch:  Analysts, on average, expect Snap to report a loss of one cent per share for the third quarter, with estimates ranging between a loss of 10 cents and a profit of seven cents, according to Benzinga Pro data.
The consensus estimate models revenue of $1.14 billion for the quarter, up 6.5% from the $1.07 billion reported a year ago and almost flat with the previous quarter’s $1.111 billion.

On the contrary, DeFi and token technology has been embraced by some of the world’s most innovative companies, if not silently. The original obscurity and nerves by some to get involved have dissipated, but if some worries still remain here’s a few behemoths plunging into DeFi whole hog:
Google’s parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has been one of the most active investors in cryptocurrencies and DeFi technology. The innovation goliath invested a whopping $1.5 billion into four separate blockchain companies between September 2021 to June 2022. Those investments included digital custody company Fireblocks, venture capital firm Digital Currency Group, the lightning node infrastructure platform Voltage and blockchain video games company Dapper Labs. As a matter of fact, there does not appear to be an alternative investment vehicle in the crypto sphere that Alphabet has not embraced. Ever since Meta, formerly Facebook, unveiled its plan for the so-called “metaverse,” Alphabet has plowed billions into similarly-related technology. That in itself has opened the door for alternative investments inside the metaverse, like NFTs and digital real estate.

What’s Happened: Tuesday marked the worst day for the major stock market indexes.
The markets traded down after the CPI inflation data showed an 8.3% rise in August. The figure was lower than the 8.5% increase reported in July but came in ahead of an 8.1% figure many were expecting.

Fire & Ice: Part Deux
Recall earlier this month when the S&P 500 index extended its losses to three straight weeks? Wilson, a Morgan Stanley equity strategist, blamed the Federal Reserve.
“With the Fed emphatically dashing hopes for a dovish pivot, we think that asset markets may be entering 'fire and ice part deux,'"" he said.
In contrast to part one, the decline in stocks would come mostly via a higher equity risk premium and lower earnings, Wilson added. He also correctly predicted that the decline in S&P 500 earnings was far from over.
“In short, part deux will be more icy than fiery,"" he said. ""The opposite of 1H22.”

What Happened: Merriam-Webster, which is the oldest dictionary company in the U.S., announced the addition of 370 words to the dictionary for the month of September.

Munger, a close aide of Warren Buffett, said envy is built in human nature.
“I have conquered envy in my own life. I don’t envy anybody. I don’t give a damn what somebody else has. But other people are going crazy by it,” Munger had said.
