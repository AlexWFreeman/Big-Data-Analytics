The Analyst Ratings: Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Ng initiated coverage on the following stocks with the following price targets.

Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA): Buy rating, $44 price target
Fox Corp (NASDAQ:FOX)(NASDAQ:FOXA): Buy rating, $42 price target

Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA)(NASDAQ:PARAA): Sell rating, $9.50 price target
Stagwell Inc (NASDAQ:STGW): Neutral rating, $6.50 price target
The Analyst Takeaways: Competition from streaming platforms, social media and technology companies is challenging the media sector, Ng wrote in a new investor note.
""We prefer U.S. media stocks with deep competitive moats that should provide better visibility into growth,"" Ng said.
The analyst said lower exposure to linear television, higher exposure to sports and news, strong portfolios of brands and a direct-to-consumer segment close to profitability will make a media company stand out.
""The U.S. media conglomerates (DIS, FOXA, WBD, PARA and CMCSA) have an average growth outlook that includes 3% revenue growth, 5% EBIT growth, and 7% EPS growth.""
Ng said the media sector faces increased competition as social media and internet companies establish direct relationships with consumers.
""This shift from traditional to internet content distribution has reduced the bargaining power of TV/film studios and linear TV networks.""
Media companies also face the ongoing threat from streaming leader Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), Ng wrote.

An epic battle that saw retail traders take on hedge funds played out in early 2021 and centered around video game retailer GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME).
Here’s a look back at what happened, what’s happened since and what could be next.
What Happened: Struggling video game retailer GameStop became the target of short sellers betting on a further decline or bankruptcy. Community support on the r/Wallstreetbets subreddit and other social media outlets led to an epic short squeeze story that dominated the headlines in early 2021 and throughout the year.
One of the places where the short squeeze story gained steam was on Benzinga’s “Power Hour” show, where Citron Research’s Andrew Left joined to share his thesis on why he was betting against GameStop.
On Jan. 21, Left was interviewed live and the video had thousands of messages in the chat defending GameStop’s future growth and why Left was wrong.
The stock rose on the day and over the next several days, leading the Benzinga interview to be one of the places considered as the “room where it happened.”
Two other central figures in the GameStop storyline were Ryan Cohen and Keith Patrick Gill. 
Cohen is the founder of Chewy Inc (NYSE: CHWY) and is now the chairman of the video game retailer. Cohen took a 9% stake in GameStop which was announced in August 2020 and increased his stake to 13% in 2021, becoming a hero figure for those rallying around GameStop.
Keith Patrick Gill, who went by the handle Roaring Kitty on YouTube and DeepF***ingValue on Reddit, placed a $56,000 bet on GameStop through call options and posted his research to YouTube and Reddit. Gill’s investment was worth tens of millions of dollars in January 2021.

Kostin stated in a note released Monday.
Election Impact on Markets
Investors are closely watching Thursday’s first presidential debate, which is expected to influence betting-based predictions of the election outcomes. According to betting website Polymarket, there is a 57.5% likelihood of a Trump win and a 34.5% chance of a Biden win (FiveThirtyEight currently shows a dead heat between the two candidates).
Additionally, there is a 73% chance of Republicans winning the Senate and a 54% chance of Democrats retaining control of the House. The probability of a Republican sweep stands at 42%, nearly double the 22% odds of a Democratic sweep.
Historical Performance Trends
Goldman Sachs highlighted historical trends where U.S. stocks with a focus on domestic sales outperformed those with greater international exposure by 1 percentage point (pp) the day after Trump’s election and by 4 pp in the following month. However, these domestically-focused stocks underperformed by 9 pp during the 12 months after the election.

Bank of America on Netflix: The first quarter showed that Netflix is ""SUBstantially ahead"" of other streaming companies, Ehrlich said.
Ehrlich said Netflix's first-quarter results showed the company still had several key growth drivers, including the ramp of the ad-tier, the continued benefit of password sharing crackdown, a strong 2024 content slate, a strong subscriber base in developing markets and the potential of price increases.
The big item that could be weighing on Netflix shares is the company's decision to stop sharing paid subscriber figures and average revenue per member in 2024.
""While still early, the potential concern is subscriber growth had significantly decelerated in 2022 (prior to the implementation of paid sharing), and this could be a harbinger of decelerating subscriber growth in the future,"" Ehrlich said.
The analyst said Netflix should continue to outperform going forward.
Wedbush on Netflix: The decision to stop sharing subscriber metrics was the key takeaway for Reese.

While index futures on Friday clawed back some earlier losses, sentiment remains fragile following Israel’s missile strikes on Iran in response to drone attacks and as explosions were reported in Syria and Iraq.
Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), the first major tech company to report earnings, disappointed investors with comments about ending membership guidance. Investors may also turn their attention to upcoming regional bank earnings reports. With commodities retreating from their initial spikes and bond yields falling, a potential reversal in sentiment remains in play despite the extended decline.
The session will also likely see volatility as options contracts tied to about $3 trillion in stocks, equity indexes, and exchange-traded funds expire on Friday.

The lean patch on Wall Street continued on Wednesday despite the bond yields coming off recent highs. The culprit this time around was the premonition of potential earnings slowdown, especially from red-hot AI-levered companies, after Dutch semiconductor-equipment maker ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) was disappointed with a first-quarter revenue miss.
Mortgage Bankers’ Association’s weekly mortgage applications volume data showed that 30-year fixed mortgage rates rising to their highest level since December 2023, also stirred inflation worries and weighed down on sentiment.
The major indices opened higher but reversed course immediately after, declining through the morning and hitting the day’s low by the mid-session.

Here's a look at earnings estimates, what analysts are saying and key items to watch.
Earnings Estimates: Analysts estimate Netflix will report first-quarter revenue of $9.275 billion, according to data from Benzinga Pro.
The streaming company reported revenue of $8.162 billion in last year's first quarter. The company has beaten Street estimates in two of the last four quarters, including the most recently reported fourth quarter.
Netflix said during its fourth-quarter earnings report that it expects first-quarter revenue to be $9.24 billion, which would be up 13.2% year-over-year.
Analysts expect the company to report first-quarter earnings per share of $4.52, up from $2.88 reported in the prior year's first quarter. The company has beaten earnings per share estimates from analysts in three of the last four quarters.
Netflix guidance calls for first-quarter earnings per share of $4.49.
The streaming company reported 13.12 million net subscriber adds in the fourth quarter, taking its total to 260.28 million. Netflix guidance said net subscriber adds would be down sequentially, but should come in higher than the 1.8 million net adds reported in the first quarter of 2023.
What Analysts Are Saying: The ad-supported plan and paid sharing crackdowns from Netflix could lead to more upside, according to Macquarie analyst Tim Nollen.
The analyst, who has an Outperform rating on the stock, said Netflix could have more upside when comparing his original estimates on ad-tier and paid sharing to where the company is now.

January CPI Preview: What Are Economists Expecting?

Economists are projecting a notable decline in the annual headline inflation rate, from 3.4% in December to 2.9% in January, driven by base effects and lower energy prices. Should these forecasts hold true, it would mark the lowest inflation rate since February 2021.
On a month-over-month basis, the CPI is expected to rise by 0.2%, maintaining December’s growth rate.
Excluding volatile components such as energy and food, the annual core inflation rate is anticipated to decrease from 3.9% to 3.7%, the lowest point since April 2021.

Here’s a look at how much return an investment in a basket comprising the Magnificent seven stocks in equal proportion would have fetched vis-a-vis Cathie Wood-led Ark Investment’s flagship Ark Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK).
New Group On The Block: FAANG was the precursor to the group, now collectively called the Magnificent Seven. Originally named FANG by Jim Cramer in 2013, the group became known as FAANG with the addition of Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in 2017. The original members were Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), which then went by the name Facebook, Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), formerly Google.
Later iterations were MAGA, which included Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) along with Apple, Alphabet and Amazon, and MAMAA, comprising Meta, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon.
The phrase Magnificent Seven was first used by BofA Securities analyst Michael Hartnett in 2023. The constituent companies spearheaded the stock market rebound during the year, thanks to the dominant market positioning, innovativeness, brand appeal and financial muscle of these companies. This group comprises the biggest mega-cap techs including Meta, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA).

The focus shifts to preliminary fourth-quarter GDP data before the market opens and the European Central Bank’s rate decision, with traders anticipating the central bank to maintain its current stance.
Cues From Wednesday's Trading:
U.S. stocks closed with a mixed performance on Wednesday, as the Dow Industrials moved further away from its all-time highs, while the S&P 500 marked its fourth consecutive all-time closing high. The varied sentiment unfolded as traders absorbed a positive quarterly report from Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and better-than-expected private sector activity data. The subdued sentiment might be attributed to concerns ahead of key economic data scheduled for release on Thursday and Friday.
Strength in the communication services sector, led by Netflix, along with gains in energy stocks, helped offset weakness in utility, real estate, material, consumer staples, and financial stocks.

Earnings releases from 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) and General Electric Co. (NYSE:GE) led to a pullback in their stocks during premarket trading. Meanwhile, shares of consumer and personal products company Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) rose in response to its earnings.
The focus now shifts to after-hours trading when streaming giant Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and semiconductor company Texas Instruments, Inc. (NASDAQ:TXN) are set to report. On the economic front, Tuesday represents a lull before a slew of key data, including the Fed’s favorite inflation gauge, begins to roll in.
Cues From Monday's Trading:
U.S. stocks closed higher for a third consecutive session on Monday, with small-caps leading the charge. Although the major averages opened higher, the strength of the rally waned after a report revealed that the Conference Board’s leading economic index fell once again in December. Despite this, the indices showcased resilience, remaining above the unchanged line throughout the session, albeit closing off the highs.
The S&P 500 and the 30-stock Dow Industrial average concluded at fresh all-time highs, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite reached a two-year high. Notably, the Nasdaq 100 Index, consisting of the largest non-financial tech stocks, also achieved record territory.
Among S&P 500 sector indices, buying interest, albeit subdued, was nearly broad-based, with only consumer and utility stocks losing ground.

Earnings could exert a significant influence on stocks and the market this week, overshadowing economic data. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC), and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) are among the key companies set to release earnings reports, likely capturing investors’ attention.
Traders will receive data on the central bank’s preferred inflation gauge, specifically the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Index, on Friday. This number could be crucial as it is expected to shape investor expectations regarding the upcoming rate decision on Jan. 31.
Cues From Last Week's Trading:
Stocks closed the holiday-shortened week ending Jan. 19 on a positive note. Traders overcame early-week jitters caused by some Federal Reserve officials and economic data that dampened hopes of rate cuts. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited’s (NYSE:TSM) strong outlook attracted buyers back into the market on Thursday. This positive sentiment drove the S&P 500 Index to a record high in Friday’s session.
LPL Financial Chief Global Strategist Quincy Krosby noted, “As technology, semiconductors, and consumer discretionary led the S&P 500 to new highs, it reflected the strength of the growth sectors that underpinned the inherent strength in the bull market that was born earlier last year.”

""It's a $4,000 product. That is not something that is going to be widely purchased,"" said Faber. Cramer agreed with him, even jokingly pointing out that he had to turn down a unit that was being sent to him because it was ""too expensive.""

During the previous month, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) surged by 3.4% compared to the previous year, surpassing the forecasted 3.2% increase. Core inflation stood at 3.9% annually, exceeding the expected 3.8%, primarily driven by the persistent high costs of shelter.
Latest Fed remarks had a chilling effect on the markets. Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin indicated his willingness to consider rate reductions once inflation is on track to reach 2%, while Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester expressed the view that March might be too early for a rate cut.
In response, traders adjusted their expectations for interest rates, with the implied probability of a March rate cut falling from 70% to around 63%, while maintaining their overall bet of six rate cuts throughout 2024.
Meanwhile, Treasury yields remained relatively stable, while the U.S. dollar strengthened by 0.2%.

(NYSE:DIS), Warner Bros Discovery Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD), Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), and Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) are reportedly battling enormous losses from their streaming services in the face of stiff competition from Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX).
What Happened: As reported by the Financial Times, these established entertainment firms have incurred over $5 billion in losses over the past year from their online platforms. Consequently, they are facing mounting pressure to downsize or divest legacy businesses, restrict production, and minimize costs.
Paramount, guided by billionaire majority shareholder Shari Redstone, is allegedly considering a sale to production firm Skydance. Additionally, deliberations about a possible merger between Paramount and Warner are in progress, albeit still in preliminary stages with no certainty surrounding a deal.
Analyst Rich Greenfield characterized Paramount’s deal discussions as a reflection of the industry’s “complete and utter panic,” as per FT. He notes challenges such as falling TV advertising, accelerating cord-cutting, rising sports costs, and underperforming movie business, creating a scenario where mergers and cost-cutting appear to be the survival strategy.
Bob Iger, Disney’s CEO, hinted at a potential strategic shift, openly pondering whether some of Disney’s assets fit within the ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","News,Analyst Color,Entertainment,Top Stories,Tech,Media"

A small difference in returns, to be sure, but also a great indication that growth leadership names may be due for a pullback, while value sectors are not showing the same extreme momentum conditions. 
A number of mega cap growth stocks were overbought recently, and just as they were testing resistance from the summer highs. Charts like NFLX (NASDAQ: NFLX) are perfect examples of this short-term bearish signal, where a stock that has a quick run higher often needs to take a break and reset before the uptrend can continue.

What could a pullback look like for the QQQ (NASDAQ: QQQ), and what would that mean for conditions heading into January 2024?  And what other scenarios are a possibility for growth stocks?  Let’s lay out four potential outcomes for the Nasdaq 100, and I’ll share my estimated probability for each scenario.
And remember the point of this exercise is threefold:

Consider all four potential future paths for the index, think about what would cause each scenario to unfold in terms of the macro drivers, and review what signals/patterns/indicators would confirm the scenario.
Decide which scenario you feel is most likely, and why you think that's the case. Don't forget to drop me a comment and let me know your vote!
Think about how each of the four scenarios would impact your current portfolio. How would you manage risk in each case? How and when would you take action to adapt to this new reality?

Let's start with the most optimistic scenario, involving a new all-time high in January 2024.
Option 1: The Very Bullish Scenario

The FOMC is now proceeding carefully, acknowledging that substantial tightening in financial conditions can result from an increase in bond yields, subsequently affecting policy decisions, Powell said. A period of above-trend growth may still imply “meaningful tightening” of interest rates, he said. 
In response to Powell’s comments being interpreted as dovish, traders scaled back their expectations for interest rate hikes. Presently, the market is pricing in a 96% probability that interest rates will remain unchanged in November.
Investors also reacted to mixed earnings from major U.S. corporations. Tesla, Inc. experienced a significant decline of more than 9%, marking its worst session since early January 2023, in response to disappointing earnings. On the other hand, Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) saw a 16% increase in its stock price, fueled by better-than-expected results and a substantial surge in subscribers. This performance marked the largest one-day increase for Netflix since January 2021.

Patterson upgraded Netflix shares from “Sector Weight” and set a $510 price target for the stock, implying a substantial 47% upside potential from current levels. This revised price target is determined by a valuation multiple of 25 times the estimated earnings for 2025.
The Netflix Thesis

Here’s a look at the estimates from analysts, their latest commentary, and the primary concerns for investors and analysts.
Earnings Estimates: Netflix is expected to report third-quarter revenue of $8.537 billion, according to data from Benzinga Pro.
The revenue would be an increase on the $7.926 billion reported in the same quarter of the last fiscal year.
Netflix has missed revenue estimates from analysts in five of the last seven quarters, including the first and second quarters of the current fiscal year.
Analysts expect Netflix to report earnings per share of $3.47 for the third quarter, up from last year’s $3.10 reported in the third quarter. The company has beaten earnings per share estimates in seven of the last eight quarters.
Guidance from Netflix released during its second quarter financial results calls for revenue of $8.52 billion and earnings per share of $3.52.
“We expect revenue growth will accelerate in the second half of 2023 as monetization grows from our most recent paid sharing launch and we expand out initiative across nearly all remaining countries plus the continued steady growth in our ad-supported plan,” Netflix said at the time.

What Analysts are Saying: Several analysts have released updated notes ahead of the third quarter earnings from Netflix.

The analyst, who has a Hold rating and $430 price target on shares, said second-half expectations for Netflix are “reasonable.”

According to a report by Barron’s, UBS analyst John Hodulik suggests that benefits from Netflix’s clampdown on password sharing and the introduction of ad-supported streaming may not be immediate. Consequently, Hodulik lowered his target price on the stock from $525 to $500, while maintaining a Buy rating.

Despite a 21% increase in the stock’s value this year, it has seen a significant drop from over $450 in July. This decline has been primarily due to investors’ disappointment over cautious remarks on margins and subscriber growth last month.

As streaming platforms join the bidding war for these sports rights, one analyst suggests a bold move for the NFL.
The Disney Analyst: Needham analyst Laura Martin has a Hold rating and no price target on The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS).
The Analyst Takeaways: Disney is one of the media partners of the NFL with its ESPN unit having rights to “Monday Night Football” games, some of which also air on ABC. 
Many speculate that ESPN, owned by Disney, could be on the chopping block with any asset sales. The company’s ABC network could also be sold, which leads to Martin’s latest take on Disney.
“The NFL should buy ABC from Disney. The NFL is standing by and witnessing the destruction of the linear TV ecosystem, with its powerful economics that largely flow to the NFL and other sports leagues,” Martin said.
Martin said the NFL has used the ability to sell TV rights to a number of networks as a bargaining chip to maximize revenue.

It looks to introduce an ad-free tier to Prime Video for an additional $2.99/month for U.S. Amazon Prime members, followed by a global rollout in 2024. 
Wedbush analyst Scott Devitt reiterated Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) with an Outperform and a $180 price target.
Devitt thinks the impact of a worldwide rollout is in the range of $6.6 billion - $8.0 billion of incremental revenue. 
The ad-free offering ($2.99/month) represents a ~20% hike to the monthly Amazon Prime subscription price in the U.S. ($14.99) or a ~26% increase on the annual fee ($139). 
Over time, the analyst assumes that Amazon can implement similar 20% - 26% increases over local subscription prices in international markets for the ad-free tier.

The bond market continued its downward spiral, with Treasury yields soaring to levels not seen in over a decade across maturities ranging from 10 to 30 years.
The energy sector continued to outperform, driven by oil giants capitalizing on crude prices that have remained at or above $90 per barrel.
The U.S. dollar surged to its highest point in the past 10 months, on track for its eleventh consecutive week of gains. This remarkable ascent has been propelled by the Federal Reserve’s hawkish stance and deteriorating economic prospects in Europe.

Inflation Surges, Driven By Gas
In August, the annual inflation rate in the United States saw its second consecutive increase, reaching 3.7%. This was a notable uptick from July’s 3.2% figure, surpassing expectations of 3.6%. On a monthly basis, the Consumer Price Index surged by 0.6%, marking its most substantial monthly increase since June 2022.
This spike was primarily fueled by a substantial 6% rise in gasoline prices. In a parallel trend, the Producer Price Index also displayed robust growth in August, with a 0.7% monthly increase, the highest level recorded since June 2022, outstripping market forecasts of a 0.4% uptick.
Core Inflation Downtrend Continues, Investor Confidence Holds
A different perspective emerges when volatile food and energy components are excluded from inflation calculations, an aspect closely monitored by the Federal Reserve. The core CPI experienced a slight decrease from 4.7% to 4.3% year-on-year, while the core PPI dropped to a year-on-year rate of 2.2%,reaching its lowest point since January 2021.

The unexpected uptick, also coupled with a monthly core inflation exceeding expectations (0.3% vs. 0.2%), did not lead to significant disruptions in the interest rate landscape.
The increase, primarily driven by a rise in energy prices, was perceived by the market as something the Fed is likely to look through. Consequently, expectations have remained unchanged, with traders now almost certainly pricing in a hold on rates at the FOMC meeting next week, while uncertainties linger regarding the November decision.

All eyes are on the upcoming FOMC meeting, with the meeting beginning Tuesday and the Fed delivering a rate decision statement Wednesday.

The S&P 500 Index rose 0.5%, while the Nasdaq 100 Index was unchanged.

The tech-heavy index is on track to suffer its worst trading session in more than a month.
On the other hand, a solid earnings beat by Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) lifted the blue-chip Dow Jones Index up 0.9%, putting it on course for its ninth consecutive session of gains, the longest winning run since September 2017.
On the macro front, jobless claims came in below expectations last week, signaling a still-resilient job market. Speculators upped their bets for another rate hike after July, hedging from some unexpectedly hawkish remarks as the Federal Reserve meets next week. Both the dollar and short-term Treasury yields rallied. 
Cues From Thursday's Trading:
The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 was the weakest link on Thursday, down 1.5%. The S&P 500 contained losses, down 0.3%, while small caps in the Russell 2000 Index slipped 1%. 
The Dow was the outlier, up 0.8%, as health care, consumer staples and utilities outperformed other sectors.

The Netflix Analysts: Morgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne has an Equal-weight rating and price target of $450.
Guggenheim analyst Michael Morris has a Buy rating and $500 price target.
Baird analyst Vikram Kesavabhotla has a Neutral rating and $340 price target.
Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein has an Outperform rating and raised the price target from $500 to $515.
Needham analyst Laura Martin has a Hold rating and no price target.
KeyBanc analyst Justin Patterson has a Sector Weight rating and no price target.
William Blair analyst Ralph Schackart has an Outperform rating and no price target.
Morgan Stanley On Netflix: Netflix reported better-than-expected second-quarter subscriber additions, and its paid sharing progress was strong, Swinburne said in a note. 
“By 4Q, we expect it to deliver on its goal to reaccelerate revenue growth to double digits,” the analyst said.
The analyst calls the crackdown on password sharing a success; the strategy was viewed by some as risky due to the potential of increased churn.
“Not only is the risk now behind Netflix, but the incremental 4 million net adds upside in 2Q shows they are converting those highly engaged ‘borrowers’ to new members.”

The end of Fed hikes may be on the horizon but what about their effects on the economy?


According to TD, the peak impact from a rate hike occurs ~4 quarters later for GDP and ~6 quarters later for inflation.


In other words, what we see now is the effect of policy rates from mid-2022.


That means the peak impact of rate hikes on the economy has yet to be felt.


As Apollo’s Torsen Sløk notes, this will likely lead to further deterioration in credit conditions and lending growth.



Corporate bond spreads act as a proxy for overall macro concern among bond investors.


What are they saying?


Excluding a spike in March following the banking crisis, spreads have declined since October.


In fact, spreads are just as low now as they were before the banking failures.


This suggests investors believe the impact of macro headwinds on future earnings will be minimal.



Housing starts in the US fell by more than expected in June.


Building permits also declined against estimates for a modest gain.


Permits for single-family homes (SFH), however, increased by 2.2% and have been steadily rising which points to a rebound in SFH starts ahead (chart).


On the other hand, permits for multi-family units fell to the lowest since October 2020.

An increasing share of global fund managers sees it as the most likely outcome over the next 12 months:

Macro
Here are some highlights from BofA’s latest Global Fund Manager Survey:


Investors still expect global growth to weaken in the next 12 months.


But only 48% predict a recession by the end of Q1 2024.


In fact, most (68%) see a soft landing as the most likely outcome over the next year.


Sentiment, however, is still stubbornly low.


Investors expect the Fed’s first cut will come in Q2 2024.



June’s retail sales report revealed mixed signals about consumer strength.


Headline sales missed expectations, rising by 0.2% (vs. 0.5% expected) MoM to 1.5% YoY (vs. 1.6% expected).


On the other hand, spending on the core/control group–which excludes food, autos, gas, and building materials and is used to calculate GDP–jumped by 0.6%.


Overall, consumer spending softened but flashed resilience in June amid higher prices and borrowing costs.



Homebuilder confidence rose for the 7th consecutive month in July.


The NAHB Housing Market Index is at its highest since June 2022.


With record-low inventories boosting demand, why wouldn’t it be?


According to Redfin, the total number of homes for sale dropped 15% YoY in June to an all-time low (chart).


At the same time, home prices may have bottomed: June’s median sale price decline was the smallest of the past 5 months (chart) and homes are beginning to sell above their list prices.

Given Pachter's view that the company can generate significantly more free cash flow than its guidance suggests, Netflix remains on Wedbush's Best Ideas List.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated at the ECB Forum on Central Banking that additional interest rate hikes – at least two – are on the way this year, without ruling out hiking at consecutive meetings. Furthermore, the Fed chair said the U.S. economy is highly resilient, and that a recession, while possible, is not the most likely scenario.
The Fed is due to release the results of its annual stress tests for banks at 4:30 p.m. EDT Wednesday.

The S&P 500 was slightly up (0.1%) as of midday trading, while the Dow slipped 0.2%. 
The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 posted a 0.6% uptick, while small caps in the Russell 2000 gained 0.3%

Nearly all FOMC participants anticipated it would be reasonable to raise interest rates somewhat more by year’s end, Powell said, stressing that the decision to pause hikes doesn’t mean the end of tightening. 
The market slide was spurred by the negative performance from tech titans, with Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) down 4.5%, 2.4% and 2.3%, respectively.
FedEx Corp. (NYSE:FDX) reported slightly better-than-anticipated earnings, but missed revenue estimates and provided disappointing guidance for the upcoming quarters.
Earlier in the day, markets negatively reacted to a hotter-than-expected U.K. inflation rate in May, which fueled expectations for more aggressive Bank of England rate hikes. 
Traders increased their expectations for a 25-basis-point Fed rate hike in July, from 62% last week to 79% today. This shift caused U.S. Treasury yields to move higher during the session. 
Cues From Wednesday’s Trading:
The S&P 500 Index fell 0.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index lost 170 points or 1.1% for the day. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average held steady, while small caps in the Russell 2000 had a timid 0.1% drop.

Amid unconfirmed reports, let's delve into the most recent news and speculation.
What Happened: Media giant Paramount has been exploring the sale of BET Media Group, which includes the cable networks BET and VH1, as Benzinga reported in March 2023.
Among the interested parties in BET Media Group have been Tyler Perry and Byron Allen.
BET was founded in 1980 by Bob Johnson and has served as a leading media outlet for the Black community, often a place to showcase the talents of underrepresented performers in movies, television and music.
Johnson sold BET to Viacom in 2000 for $2.3 billion.
Perry’s name has generated the most buzz with his success in launching several media brands and being a leading content creator of movies and television shows. In 2019, Perry also contributed to the launch of the BET+ streaming subscription service under Paramount, in which he owns a minority share.
Several media outlets have indicated that a deal between Perry and Paramount has been reached. Hip Hop Vibe reported Perry bought BET Media Group for $400 million.

What Investors Need To Know
Economists expect retail sales to rebound 0.7% month over month in April, after falling 0.6% in March.

In annual terms, retail sales jumped 2.3% in March — the smallest surge since May 2020. 
Core retail sales (excluding automobiles) will likely increase 0.4% in April, rebounding from a 0.4% drop in March.

Increasing interest rates and cost concerns are weighing on consumers' propensity to spend.
If retail sales fall in April, it would mark the third consecutive month of reductions. The last time three consecutive negative retail sales reports occurred was from August to October in 2015.

Analyst Color: 
The Fed could stay on course despite the economic slowdown and raise rates at the upcoming May 2-3 meeting, according to Jeffrey Roach, the chief economist at LPL Financial.
“Businesses appeared to hunker down under the weight of tighter credit conditions and weaker economic growth. If small businesses are an accurate barometer, recession risks are rising and the labor market will likely cool in the coming months,” the analyst said. He does not rule out the possibility of a rate cut by the end of the year if the economy becomes more unstable.

The Analyst Takeaways: Thornton called the first quarter results mixed, with several positives and negatives from the company. Among the positives were the average revenue per user for the ad-supported plan coming in higher than expected, and a private marketplace being built for ad inventory.
Negatives for the analyst were guidance below consensus, a lack of ad-supported tiers and the password-sharing crackdown being delayed.
“The company is upgrading its Basic with Ads tier as opposed to launching Standard and Premium equivalent ad tiers,” Thornton said. “Not sure the rationale, though other tiers could/should still come in the future, in our view.”
Helfstein sees a strong future for Netflix given its password-sharing crackdown and the early results in Canada, with comments that revenue was growing faster in the country than in the U.S. The analyst also sees the comments on the ad-supported plan as a positive development.

St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said he still expects hikes and did not rule out pushing the Fed funds rate in the 5.5%-5.75% range. 
Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic stated that he expects another rate rise in May, followed by a rate hold in June, stating that inflation remains too high.
Investors now almost fully discount a 25-basis-point hike in May, according to the CME Group Fedwatch tool, and have also priced out a rate cut expected as early as July.

Here are the key items analysts are watching ahead of the report and what they see ahead for the streaming leader.
Truist Sizes Up Password Sharing: Several research firms have conducted surveys of streaming subscribers to see how important the crackdown on password sharing could be for Netflix's business. 
“We raise our annuals on our password sharing survey and view consensus annual revenue/EBIT/EPS/members as high/reasonable/reasonable/reasonable hurdles,” Truist analyst Matthew Thornton said.
The analyst, who has a Hold rating and price target of $339, is positive on Netflix's growth with the password sharing crackdown and strength of advertising along with other potential catalysts like video games.
Thornton expects first-quarter subscriber additions for Netflix to come in ahead of consensus estimates, with an estimate of 3 million versus a Street estimate of 2 million.
“Download declines quarter-over-quarter were better 1Q23 than 1Q22 and we expect churn quarter-over-quarter to have been better 1Q23 than 1Q22.”
A survey from Truist shows that 33% of those who share passwords would no longer use Netflix and 28% would get their own new account.
“The result is a 4.5% lift to members, 5.7% lift to revenue and 19% or 19.8 million decline in total users.”

Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management Group, said, “While we don’t think earnings season will bring much in the way of good news, expectations are low enough that we may see stocks hold up again after results just as they generally did during fourth-quarter earnings season in late January through mid-February.”

Interest-rate sensitive mega caps, such as Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL), have gained more than 2% on the day. A weaker greenback, with EUR/USD hitting fresh yearly highs, also supported stock advances. 
Cues From Thursday's Trading: 
Producer price inflation (PPI) decreased by 0.5% in March, falling short of forecasts for a flat monthly reading, while weekly unemployment claims surged by 11,000 to 239,000, above expectations. The two findings signal that a cooling trend in pricing pressures and the labor market is already underway.
Stocks rallied across the board as investors wagered the Federal Reserve will stop raising in June and deliver the first reduction as early as July, according to latest CME Group FedWatch tool.
The S&P 500 index gained 0.7%, returning above 4,100 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average grew 0.4%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 outperformed, gaining 1.4%. Small caps in the Russell 2000 index were also higher, up 0.9%.

The market's interpretation of these two data releases has rekindled hopes for a pause in interest rate hikes following the Federal Reserve's May meeting, with rate cut bets rising from the July meeting.
The stock market reacted positively, with major U.S. and global equity markets all in the green, celebrating the growing conviction the rate hike cycle that began in March 2022 is soon coming to an end.

What Happened: Rahm was one of several betting favorites ahead of the 2023 Masters Tournament.
Sportsbooks were mixed on who was the favorite to take home the coveted green jacket over the four-day tournament. Many sportsbooks like DraftKings Inc (NASDAQ: DKNG) had Rahm listed as a co-favorite alongside Rory McIlroy and Scottie Scheffler.

One thing was certain, Rahm was a favorite to win the 2023 Masters.
Rahm entered what was expected to be a two-person duel for the Masters championship on Sunday, trailing leader Brooks Koepka. Sportsbooks had Koepka as the favorite entering the fourth round with odds of +100 and Rahm as the underdog at odds of +150.

Amidst the buzz, Bilawal Sidhu stands out as an AI expert and visionary creator, helping brands leverage AI to engage consumers more effectively.
Benzinga spoke with Sidhu to gain insights into his journey and thoughts on the future of AI. Below is a lightly edited version of the conversation that transpired.
Nice to meet you, Bilawal! I hear such great things about you. Care to start with an introduction?
I’m a third culture kid that grew up across India, the U.K. and the U.S.
The computer graphics bug bit me at 11, and it’s been a passion of mine since. This fueled my interest in creative technology and set a foundational theme in my life — the quest to blend the physical and digital worlds. I studied engineering and business at the University of Southern California. From then on, I spent a decade working in augmented and virtual reality, or AR and VR, primarily at Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG)-owned Google.
I’ve had the privilege of building products and experiences with world-class teams that shattered the physical and digital divide. Along the way, I’ve been flexing my creative muscles on social media platforms like YouTube and TikTok, where I have over a million subscribers.
What was it like working as a product manager at Google?
My work at Google has been on 0-to-1 products built on unique datasets. When I started, AR and VR were nascent mediums, and we were laying the foundational building blocks. We created new ways to capture the world, model it with greater realism and understand what’s in it.
Later, we combined those primitives together to help users explore the world around them in an immersive fashion.
Younger generations have spent their formative years in immersive 3D worlds like Roblox Corp (NYSE: RBLX), and their expectations go far beyond the paper maps you and I grew up with.
For instance, if you’re planning your weekend escape, you want to view the best hotels, restaurants and parks. Right now, that’s a painfully chaotic, multi-tab browser endeavor. Today's users want to explore a place remotely and figure out where and when to go.
The immersive view combines Google’s understanding of the real world to let you do that vibe check with just a few taps.
Any experiences that have altered the way you view the world?
My work on 3D mapping in the Geo team takes the cake here. I can no longer walk around a city without seeing a machine-readable 3D model in my head.
We re-mapped the world with satellites, planes and ground-level sensors. We then fused these data sources together to create a ground-up 3D digital twin — perhaps the most ubiquitous model of this pale blue dot we call home. This digital twin connects the world of bits and atoms and powers everything from navigation to flood forecasting, even turning the world into a 3D canvas for AR developers.
Anyone can now build apps that understand where they are, and what they’re looking at and annotate the world around them with remarkable accuracy. This is a fundamental building block for AR experiences anchored in the real world — whether it’s to help you park your scooter or catch a Gorillaz concert in Times Square.
Of course, it’s mobile AR today, but as headsets come online, services like this will be fundamental to the future.

What’s the motivation for staying on platforms like YouTube and TikTok?

What Happened: The battle for streaming rights to professional sports leagues could be one of the biggest storylines in the streaming sector. Apple secured the rights to Major League Soccer for 10 years, with the deal set to kick off in late February.

Along with streaming games, Apple is also launching MLS Season Pass, a new subscription service for soccer fans in over 100 countries and regions. The MLS Season Pass has a cost of $99 per season or $79 per season for existing AppleTV+ subscribers. Monthly subscriptions are also available for $14.99 and $12.99, respectively.

Companies are looking for an edge with the release or original shows and movies, live sports and other exclusives.
Here’s a look at the latest from Paramount Global (NASDAQ: PARA) (NASDAQ: PARAA) and how it stacks up to rivals.
What Happened: Paramount Global reported revenue of $8.13 billion in the fourth quarter, which was up 2% year-over-year. The company reported direct-to-consumer revenue of $1.4 billion, up 30% year-over-year.
In the fourth quarter, Paramount added 9.9 million subscribers for its Paramount+ streaming platform to hit a total of more than 56 million. The company added 10.8 million total global direct-to-consumer subscribers in the fourth quarter to bring the total to 77 million across several platforms.
“Paramount continues to demonstrate the success of its global multiplatform strategy, with popular content at its core. Nowhere was this more evident than in the growth of Paramount+, which added a record 9.9 million subscribers in the fourth quarter,” Paramount CEO Bob Bakish said.
Paramount also announced it will raise the prices of its streaming service as it rebrands to combine with Showtime in the third quarter of 2023. The new platform will be called Paramount+ with Showtime.
“We all know streaming represents incredible value for consumers and the Paramount Plus offering is far from the industry price leader. We are on the value end of the pricing spectrum,” Bakish said on the company’s earnings call.
The fourth quarter report came on the heels of a 13F filing showing that legendary investor Warren Buffett increased the position of Paramount in Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE:","News,Earnings,Entertainment,Top Stories,Trading Ideas,General"

Gaming fits into the ETF management company’s thesis that time spent on games and digital goods could continue.
Here are the two gaming-related companies that are owned by Ark Invest in the ETFs and why the company sees them as the way to play the sector.
What Happened: Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood shared a thesis on investing in gaming companies Roblox Corp (NYSE: RBLX) and Unity Software (NYSE: U) in previous interviews and write-ups.
Ark portfolio manager Nick Grous added more details and gave an update to Benzinga as to why these two gaming-related stocks are the big bets Ark Invest is placing on the sector.
“If you look at the solution that Roblox offers, Roblox isn’t necessarily a video game publisher, it’s actually a video game platform,” Grous said.
The Ark Invest portfolio manager added vertical integration for a company such as Roblox is important when considering investments in the gaming space. Grous said Roblox is probably more similar to YouTube than it is to other video game publishers.
Like Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL)-owned YouTube, Roblox has user-generated experiences that drive the content, Grous said.
As an example, Grous highlighted within a week of “Squid Game” going viral on streaming platform Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX), ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","Gaming,Top Stories,Exclusives,After-Hours Center,Trading Ideas,Interview,General"

The Disney Analysts: Loop Capital analyst Alan Gould had a Buy rating and raised the price target from $120 to $130.
RBC Capital Markets analyst Kutgun Maral had an Outperform rating and a price target of $130.
Needham analyst Laura Martin had a Hold rating and no price target.
Morgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne had an Overweight rating and a price target of $115.
Goldman Sachs analyst Brett Feldman had a Buy rating and raised the price target from $119 to $136.
Related Link: Bob Iger Returns As Disney CEO After Reports Of Growing Rift With Bob Chapek
The Analyst Takeaways: With CEO Iger returning to lead Disney, Loop Capital expected there to be an increased focus on cost savings and profitability. After the first quarter results, Gould said these efforts are “on steroids,” suggesting a more aggressive approach and quicker timeline.
“We anticipated $1.3 to $2.0 billion of cost-cutting; the company announced $5.5 billion-$3.0 billion of content and $2.5 billion of non-programming costs including 7,000 layoffs,” Gould said.
The analyst said when all the cost savings are fully factored in, it could bring an incremental $1.85 in earnings per share on top of estimates.
Gould also highlighted Disney eliminated guidance on Disney+ subscribers as it was “no longer chasing subs at all costs.”
The analyst saw a focus on cutting costs on content spending as conversative and noted programming costs were 88% of revenue for Disney+ in the quarter compared to 56% in the prior year and 45% for streaming rival Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX).
RBC Capital Markets' Maral saw a new chapter for Disney centered on “rationalizing its streaming business” with sustainable growth and profitability. The analyst called this plan “the bare necessities for a whole new world,” using well-known Disney songs.
“Key highlights include a strategic reorganization, a $5.5 billion cost savings plan, and a drastic evolution of the company’s DTC vision,” Maral said.

Brady previously announced his retirement from the league in February 2022 before deciding one month later that he would return.
Brady said in his retirement video on social media on Wednesday that this time he is stepping away from playing ""for good."" 
Brady was the oldest player in the NFL for the 2022-2023 season. Drafted 199th overall in the 2000 NFL Draft on April 6, 2000, a lot has changed since Brady first entered the league.
Here’s a look at 23 things that weren’t around when Brady joined the NFL.
Cryptocurrency: Leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) was founded in 2009, following a white paper released the previous year. The market capitalization of Bitcoin is more than $400 billion and one of many cryptocurrencies that are now readily available to trade by consumers, including on the FTX app endorsed by Brady.
Twitter: Social media platform Twitter Inc was founded in March 2006. Brady has 2.8 million followers on the social media platform as of today.
Facebook: Social media platform Facebook, which is owned by Meta Platforms inc (NASDAQ: META), was founded in 2004, two years after Brady joined the NFL.
Instagram: Photo and video sharing social media platform Instagram, which is owned by Meta Platforms, launched in 2010. Brady has more than 13 million followers on Instagram, but trails his ex-wife, model Gisele Bundchen at 20.5 million.
iPhone: Now one of the most popular smartphones in the world, the iPhone wasn’t launched until 2007 by Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL). Brady couldn’t own an iPhone until his eighth season in the NFL.
Netflix Streaming: Now used by hundreds of millions of people worldwide, the ability to stream movies and television shows from Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX) wasn’t a reality when Brady joined the league. Netflix launched in 1998 as a DVD by mail service and would later add streaming in 2007.

“A mind-boggling 142 million member households globally have chosen to watch the title in its first four weeks,” the company said at the time.

The 95th Academy Awards will air on ABC on March 12.
Can Netflix Win The Big Award?: Streaming giant Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX) had been an award favorite in recent years, and at the Golden Globes it recently won three awards from its 14 nominations.
Netflix was once again nominated for top honors in the Best Picture category with its “All Quiet on the Western Front,” a movie it acquired the rights to in 2020.
The anti-war German film is an adaptation of a 1929 novel and was also the subject of the award-winning 1930 film of the same name, which took home the Best Picture that year.
Netflix's “All Quiet on the Western Front” received nine total nominations, ranking as the second most nominated movie behind only the 10 for “Everything Everywhere All at Once.”
Netflix received a total of 15 nominations, which was among the best for streaming companies. Walt Disney Co. (NYSE: DIS) had 22 total nominations, including 12 for titles related to its Disney+ streaming platform.

Key Banc Says Multiple Expansion Unlikely: Net paid adds were materially better than expected in Latin America but slightly below expectations in the U.S. and Canada, KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Justin Patterson  said. Fourth-quarter revenue was below KeyBanc’s estimate, he said, adding that the linearity may have contributed to the miss.
See Also: Best Communication Services Stocks
Dissecting the first-quarter guidance, Patterson noted that the company expects net paid adds to be moderately positive but below fourth-quarter levels. This, according to Patterson, was consistent with normal seasonality.
The revenue guidance of $8.17 billion has factored in some conservatism around both ad-supported revenue and the impact of the paid sharing, he said. The operating margin guidance trailed KeyBanc’s estimate, with the company suggesting the relatively soft number was due to the timing of content spend, he added.
Patterson said he wasn’t overly surprised at Hastings transitioning to executive chairmanship and Greg Peters'  elevation to the co-CEO's role. Product initiatives such as paid sharing and advertising, which are handled by Peters, are of strategic importance, Patterson said.

U.S. stocks ended Wednesday’s session sharply lower, reacting to another batch of negative economic data and hawkish Fed speeches. Even as producer prices retreated more than expected, separate reports showed worse-than-expected retail sales and industrial output data. Federal Reserve’s Beige Book also raised the specter of little growth in the months ahead.
Investors, who reacted positively to bad data for most of the past year, are apparently now more worried about growth than inflation.
The major averages opened higher and built up some early momentum only to lose ground in late-morning trading. They declined steadily through the rest of the session and ended near the lows of the session, with the Nasdaq Composite Index breaking a seven-session losing streak.
Consumer staple, utility, real estate, energy, financial, industrial and IT services stocks plunged in a session that saw a broad-based sell-off.

As the earnings flow kickstarts in earnest in the unfolding week, here is Benzinga’s compilation of expectations and the key earnings reports to watch out for during the trading week: 
Q4 Sentiment Muted:  Fourth-quarter earnings from S&P 500 companies are estimated to drop 3.9% year-over-year, financial data provider FactSet’s latest weekly “Earnings Insight” report shows. This marks a slight improvement from the 4.1% drop predicted in the firm’s previous weekly report.
If the prediction for negative earnings comes true, it would mark the first drop since the third quarter of 2020.
Twenty-nine of the S&P 500 companies have reported actual results, with 23 reporting earnings outperformance relative to estimates and 20 reporting upside revenue surprise.
Early Trends Give Hope:  Of the 29 earnings reports printed so far, 79% have reported better-than-expected earnings per share, and in aggregate actual earnings exceeded estimates by 7.7%, FactSet said.
At a very early stage, the number of companies reporting positive EPS surprises and the magnitude of these EPS surprises are trending close to their five-year averages, the report said.
The forward 12-month P/E ratio for the S&P 500 Index is at 17.3, according to FactSet, which is below the five-year average of 18.5 but above the 10-year average of 17.2.
It has also improved from 15.2 at the end of the third quarter, as the index has appreciated about 11.1%. The trailing 12-month P/E ratio is 19.4, below the five-year average of 22.7 and the 10-year average of 20.5.

A new filing revealed what the Pelosis sold from their investment portfolio in late 2022.
What Happened: After ranking as one of the top 10 trading members of Congress in 2021, Pelosi didn’t crack the top 10 in 2022 and saw a return of -19.8% according to a report that tracked Congress trading during the year. 
A new filing from Pelosi showed the couple’s portfolio sold several stocks at the end of 2022, in a move that may have come in tandem with the end of the year and tax loss harvesting.
Here is a look at the transactions disclosed by the Pelosis on Friday:

Sold $500,000 to $1,000,000 of AllianceBernstein Holding LP (NYSE: AB) on Dec. 28. Comments said the sale was 20,000 shares sold at an average price of $32.95 for a loss of $11,510.

While video game adaptations have had a mixed track record at the box office, many of the recent ones have performed well as television series.
What Happened: HBO and HBO Max will premiere “The Last of Us,” a television adaptation of a bestselling video game, on Jan. 15, 2023. The debut comes shortly after HBO and HBO Max took home four wins and had 14 nominations, the most among streaming-related companies at the 2022 Golden Globes.
“The Last of Us” is based on the bestselling and award-winning video game from Naughty Dog, a unit of Sony Group Corp (NYSE: SONY). The game was released in 2013 and exclusive to consoles from Sony. A sequel released in 2020 was also among the bestselling video game titles in recent history and was widely praised.
Adapting a video game franchise into a movie or television series can be a difficult task and comes with risks and rewards with a built-in fan base that can love the idea and want to watch, or quickly turn and be upset that the content doesn’t follow the game.

A regional manufacturing reading, bond yields and the direction of oil price are among the catalysts that can impact trading in the final trading session of the year.
U.S. stocks advanced solidly on Thursday, as the year-end rally many had been hoping for materialized in the penultimate session of the year. The major indices gap opened higher and advanced steadily till early afternoon trading. Thereafter, they moved sideways before closing the session notably higher. In the process, the Nasdaq Composite recovered from a fresh bear market bottom it had hit in the previous session.
Stocks across sectors advanced on Thursday, with the beaten-down tech and consumer discretionary stocks outperforming the rest.

CFRA calls for catalysts in the form of new content, advertising revenue, new subscription plan pricing and efforts to “better control sharing of subscription accounts.”

Here’s what investors, fans of Musk and movie lovers should know.
What Happened: The Netflix movie “Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery” featured a character that might resemble Musk and be related to his acquisition of social media platform Twitter.
The character Miles Bron is a technology billionaire who has interests in space exploration and automotives, two sectors Musk had disrupted in real life. Played by Edward Norton in the movie, Bron was portrayed as someone who stole ideas and took credit for items he wasn’t behind.
Movie director Rian Johnson recently shared with Wired that Musk might have been an inspiration for the character.
Johnson told Wired he wrote the screenplay during COVID-19 lockdowns, prior to Musk announcing plans to purchase Twitter. The movie director joked he didn’t know about this ahead of time, but viewers could see parallels between the behavior of the tech billionaires both fictional and in real life. 
“It’s so weird. It’s very bizarre. I hope there isn’t some secret marketing department at Netflix that’s funding this Twitter takeover,” Johnson said.

With 2022 coming to a close, the much-anticipated ""Santa Claus rally"" period is now underway, as the markets were muted ahead of Christmas. The year's final full week of trading resulted in the S&P 500 finishing 0.20% lower, the Nasdaq Composite dropping by 1.94%, and the Dow nudging 0.86% higher to end the week.
On Friday, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported the personal consumption expenditures price index increased by 5.5% year-over-year in the month of November, down from 6.1% in October. Core PCE, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, was up 4.7%, in line with analyst estimates.
Benzinga continues to examine the prospects for many of the stocks most popular with investors. Here are a few of this past week's most bullish and bearish posts that are worth another look.

1. Johnny Depp: A defamation trial between Depp and his ex-wife Amber Heard was one of the most-talked-about events of 2022.

2. Will Smith: The 94th Academy Awards aired on ABC on March 27 and saw Smith nominated for Best Actor for his role in the sisters Venus and Serena Williams’ “King Richard” biopic. At the awards ceremony, Smith slapped host Chris Rock over a comment made about his wife Jada Pinkett Smith.

What To Know: The stock slump has to do with investors being scared that the competition will beat Netflix in streaming, Hastings said, according to a tweet from CNBC's Alex Sherman.
Netflix will have to show investors that the competition can't win, Hastings reportedly said.
The Netflix co-CEO also touched on a few things he regrets, including not introducing an ad-tier sooner and failing to acquire Wordle before the New York Times snatched it up.

Is ESPN Next? 1 Analyst Weighs In,https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/22/11/29828492/new-disney-ceo-bob-iger-is-cutting-the-fat-and-fast-is-espn-next-1-analyst-weighs-i,NFLX,Benzinga,"Media giant The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) is making a major change in a move that it hopes could help its stock price rebound and also keep fans happy after years of major concerns. The move could also see the company make major changes to its structure and business segments.
What Happened: Disney is bringing back Bob Iger as its CEO, a man who previously led the company for 15 years, before stepping down in 2020. Iger replaces Disney CEO Bob Chapek, who previously led Walt Disney.
Disney will be undergoing a restructuring effort under Iger’s leadership, according to a new report. Among the early changes is to reorganize the Disney Media & Entertainment segment. Iger announced that Kareem Daniel, chairman of media and entertainment distribution, has departed the company.
The move to bring Iger back was well received by investors, with shares of Disney up significantly on Monday, a day after the news. Analysts are now questioning what Iger being brought back could mean for the company.
“We believe Disney’s Board made the decision to reinstate Bob Iger as CEO and release existing CEO Bob Chapek for many of the same reasons they parted company with then CEO heir apparent Tom Staggs back in 2016 – lack of confidence in the executive’s creative leadership abilities,” Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Kraft said.
Kraft, who has a Buy rating and $130 price target, said the change by Disney could have a lot to do with Chapek’s handling of controversial issues. With the decision made, the analyst is now predicting what may happen with Iger once again in charge of the ""House of Mouse.""
Among the key changes Kraft highlights in the updated analyst note are driving cost efficiencies and improving profitability.

Here's the latest:

Since Elon Musk took the helm at Twitter, about half the company’s workforce was laid off.
Twitter founder Jack Dorsey took part of the blame for overgrowing the company at times of financial tailwinds.
Meta (NASDAQ: META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg shared a similar sentiment in a letter where he announced the firing of 11,000 employees — 13% of the company’s global staff.
Earlier this month, Lyft (NASDAQ: LYFT) decided to remove 13% of employees from its payroll.
Digital payments giant Stripe cut 14% of its workforce.
In August, ​​1,300 of a total of 6,400 Snapchat (NYSE: SNAP) employees were shown the door.
In July, Shopify shut down 10% of its workforce.
Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is expected to let go over 10,000 employees (it froze new hires at least until 2023)
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is also reportedly on a hiring freeze.

These are just a few examples of a trend that is reaching far more than the best-known names in tech. Layoffs.fiy, a site that has been tracking layoffs in the tech industry since the start of the pandemic, has registered 136,989 layoffs from 849 companies in 2022 alone.
Indeed, the press and public opinion made the topic a central narrative for the second half of 2022, but hard data shows that the issue is sector-specific, and the U.S. job market remains strong.

Rules For Truth Social Might Point To The Answer,https://www.benzinga.com/m-a/22/11/29810219/why-hasnt-donald-trump-tweeted-since-being-reinstated-by-elon-musk-rules-for-truth-social-might-poin,NFLX,Benzinga,"Former President Donald Trump has been reinstated on the social media platform Twitter. Many began following Trump's account and are likely wondering why he hasn’t posted yet. An SEC filing might share some clues.
What Happened: Trump was banned in January 2021 from several social media platforms, including Twitter, due to the role he played in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.
Trump was reinstated to Twitter over the weekend, thanks to a move made by Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, who acquired Twitter for $44 billion. 
Trump had already amassed more than 80 million followers on Twitter, significantly more than he has on the social media platform Truth Social, which belongs to his own company, Trump Media & Technology Group.
Investors in Digital World Acquisition Corp (NASDAQ: DWAC), a SPAC with a pending merger with Trump Media & Technology Group, are likely concerned that Trump coming back to Twitter could hurt his own platform.
The good news for Truth Social users and Digital World Acquisition investors could be some exclusivity that Truth Social has.

The Takeaways
Morgan Stanley: Disney’s earnings per share can double from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2025 as a result of the Parks segment growth and the improvement on profitability for the streaming segment, according to Swinburne.
While Disney’s fiscal 2023 guidance came in below expectations, Swinburne isn’t concerned.
“This is primarily a function of margin pressure at legacy TV networks, with lower F4Q Parks & Streaming results also contributing,"" Swinburne said. ""While guidance is a headwind to EPS recovery, we remain bullish Parks while the streaming outlook is largely unchanged.""
Expect strong growth to continue for the Parks segment, Swinburne adds.

TikTok recently announced the expansion of its universe with the inclusion of an exclusive section for video games.
The app that revolutionized the mobile video market now aims to repeat its success in the field of mobile games, albeit without neglecting its main offering.
ByteDance, the company that owns the platform, has not yet confirmed when the video game catalog will be available on the social network. As reported by the Financial Times, the official announcement should arrive in the next week.
According to the British media outlet, these games would be integrated into the existing TikTok app, so users would not have to download an additional component to access this functionality. Instead, a new exclusive tab would be added to the app.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) sent engineers and production staff from its recently upgraded Shanghai factory to its plant in Fremont, California, to boost production at the U.S. facility.
The Elon Musk-led carmaker will dispatch staff, particularly automation and control engineers, to assist efforts to increase output in Fremont, where Tesla produces the Model S, X, 3, and Y vehicles.
About 200 people will head to California on assignments that will last at least three months.

Tesla To Monetize Its Cybertruck From Next Year

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) aimed to commercialize its Cybertruck at the end of 2023, two years after the initial target for the long-awaited pickup truck CEO Elon Musk unveiled it in 2019.
A gradual ramp in the second half of next year to total output for the sharp-angled electric truck would imply that Tesla would not record revenue until early 2024.
It would also imply another year's wait for hundreds of thousands of potential buyers.

SPAC expert Julian Klymochko noted on Twitter that Mission Advancement had a deal planned in December 2021 that fell apart. One of the contributing factors to the deal collapsing was the refusal by Kaepernick to promote the merger on live television.

Mission Advancement was in talks to merge with The Change Co., a company that specializes in providing lending to minority borrowers who are underserved by traditional banks.

Here’s a look at how the prices of several top streaming platforms stack up and when consumers can pay for a cheaper Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX) and Disney+ plan.
What Happened: The launch of a highly anticipated ad-supported plan from Netflix has a release date and price.
Netflix announced it will launch its Basic with Ads platform in the U.S. and 11 other countries beginning on Nov. 3, 2022.
The plan will be available in the U.S. for $6.99 per month. The additional countries available at launch are Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Spain and the U.K.
The ad-supported plans will come with video quality of 720p/HD compared to 1080p for the Standard plan. Downloads of content will not be offered on the new ad-supported plan.
A total of four to five minutes of ads will run per hour on Netflix content on the new Basic with Ads plans. The new ad-supported plan will not include all titles either. Ads will be 15 to 30 seconds in length and play before and during shows and films.
