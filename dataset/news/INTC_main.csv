Kostin stated in a note released Monday.
Election Impact on Markets
Investors are closely watching Thursday’s first presidential debate, which is expected to influence betting-based predictions of the election outcomes. According to betting website Polymarket, there is a 57.5% likelihood of a Trump win and a 34.5% chance of a Biden win (FiveThirtyEight currently shows a dead heat between the two candidates).
Additionally, there is a 73% chance of Republicans winning the Senate and a 54% chance of Democrats retaining control of the House. The probability of a Republican sweep stands at 42%, nearly double the 22% odds of a Democratic sweep.
Historical Performance Trends
Goldman Sachs highlighted historical trends where U.S. stocks with a focus on domestic sales outperformed those with greater international exposure by 1 percentage point (pp) the day after Trump’s election and by 4 pp in the following month. However, these domestically-focused stocks underperformed by 9 pp during the 12 months after the election.

Bloomberg, which broke the story citing anonymous sources, did not mention what those potential measures entail. 
The timing of any final decision also remains uncertain.
The primary objective, per the report, is to hinder China’s capacity to develop sophisticated computing systems essential for constructing and operating artificial intelligence (AI) before it becomes widely available.
The measures are not expected to constitute a complete ban on GAA chip exports. They would instead target the technology required to manufacture them.

“The next industrial revolution has begun — companies and countries are partnering with NVIDIA to shift the trillion-dollar traditional data centers to accelerated computing and build a new type of data center — AI factories — to produce a new commodity: artificial intelligence,” said CEO Jensen Huang. 
“AI will bring significant productivity gains to nearly every industry and help companies be more cost- and energy-efficient, while expanding revenue opportunities.”
Ahead of the results, analysts were worried about the imminent launch of its next-gen AI accelerators codenamed Blackwell denting demand for the existing H200 lineup.

Deepwater Asset Management’s Gene Munster flagged a potential “Osborne effect” hurting near-term results, including that of the first quarter. The impending launch of Blackwell, Nvidia's new flagship GPU platform, this fall creates a risk for the April, July and even October quarters as customers hold back on purchases in anticipation of the new AI accelerators, he said.
Any disappointment may trigger an initial negative reaction but investors could stick with the stock, realizing “today's pain is for next quarter’s gain,” the venture capitalist said. 
Morgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore, however, called for a strong quarter and guidance, as he sees steady growth even as supply and demand shift to Blackwell.

Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann maintained a Buy rating on Nvidia with a $1,400 price target.
Mosesmann expects Nvidia to beat and raise in the April quarter, albeit not reaching the levels of the January quarter, due to improved supply and anticipated year-over-year deceleration from tougher comparisons.

The analyst noted that Nvidia still faces shortages of CoWoS and HBM, although the shortage of CoWoS will likely improve as the year progresses.
He did not buy the air-pocket theory in the Hopper to Blackwell transition for the July quarter guide, as the transition to B100 is likely for later in 2024. In reality, the transitions to B200 and GB200, both of which are 2025 products, will drive the true generational disruption. The analyst also anticipates that Blackwell will be completely sold out, at least for a year.

The tech giant’s AI infrastructure is in high demand, as evidenced by the increased capital expenditures of its major clients.
What Happened: Mega-cap tech companies are making substantial investments in Nvidia’s AI technology. According to an analysis from Business Insider, Nvidia’s H100 GPU chip, priced at over $40,000, plays a crucial role in powering AI advancements like ChatGPT and Anthropic.
Notably, Elon Musk announced on Tesla‘s earnings call that the company will double its H100 GPU chips by the end of the year. This expansion will further enhance Tesla’s Full Self-Driving software.
“We’ve installed and commissioned, meaning they’re actually working, 35,000 H100 computers or GPUs,” Musk said last month. “Roughly 35,000 H100s are active, and we expect that to be probably 85,000 or thereabouts by the end of this year.”
Meta Platforms has also increased its capex forecast for 2024, citing the buildout of its “infrastructure investments to support our AI roadmap.” The company has already purchased 850,000 H100 GPUs from Nvidia, with a retail value of approximately $30 billion.

Fed Decision
The moves came in large part due to relief at the news that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) did not intend to raise rates and is still open to lowering them before the year is out.

JPMorgan: According to Sur, Intel’s guidance suggests a slow recovery for PC and data center segments, requiring a strong second half for full-year outlook. There appear to be confidence issues in core compute and diversification initiatives. 
Customer foundry revenue was lower than expected in Q1, but product and technology pipeline remains strong. The company’s roadmap milestones are on track, with new products like Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids ramping up. Overall, while 2Q guidance is muted, there is optimism for a gradual recovery in general compute demand but Intel “will be an underperformer relative to the group over the next 12-18 months,” Sur says.

AI giants Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) set a positive tone for tech companies with strong performances in the first quarter.
However, the focus will likely shift to the annual inflation rate, as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE), the Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge. This data, released as part of the personal income and spending report at 8:30 am ET, could provide a double boost to the market. A reading in line with or below expectations could help break the recent lackluster performance.
The PCE data is particularly important because the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the Fed’s policy-setting arm, meets next Wednesday. The futures market currently prices in a 97% chance of the Fed holding rates steady.

Is Intel undervalued? byu/KimuraKan instocks


User KimuraKan initiated the conversation by pointing out Intel’s consolidation since its rise in October 2023. They pondered whether the current price range, particularly within the $35-$37 zone, presents a buying opportunity.

A lot is riding on the earnings reports of companies like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (GOOG).
The Season So Far: The percentage of S&P 500 companies that have reported positive earning surprises and the magnitude of earnings surprises are at or above their 10-year averages, said FactSet in its report released Friday. That said, substantial downward revisions to earnings per share (EPS) estimates of two healthcare companies have led to a decline in earnings growth over the past two weeks.
The combined earnings per share growth rate of S&P 500 companies, considering both the already reported actual results and the estimates for those yet to report, is at 0.5%, according to FactSet. The metric, however, fell from the 0.9% estimated previous week and the 3.4% estimated at the end of the first quarter. Earnings growth for the quarter may extend the positive growth streak to three quarters.
So far, 14% of the S&P 500 companies have reported March quarter results.

Look Ahead: The upcoming week will likely feature earnings releases from 158 S&P 500 companies, including 11 Dow 30 components. With the bank earnings tapering off, the spotlight shifts to tech companies, as they begin to roll out their quarterly scorecard this week.
Apart from some big techs, which are part of the group called the “Magnificent Seven,” homebuilders, defense contractors, airlines and transportation companies are also due to release their quarterly reports. 
All eyes are focused on Tesla as analysts expect a downbeat report from the company. Analysts see the scope of a further contraction in margin and potentially a double miss yet again in the first quarter.

White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby stated that an Iranian attack on Israel poses a ""real"" and ""viable"" threat. 
According to the Times of Israel, Hezbollah has launched a rocket barrage into Northern Israel.

The analyst listed critical takeaways from his first-quarter 2024 PC-SIGnals Intel laptop CPU share improved by +1.2% sequentially, at the highest level since the first quarter of 2022, he noted due to Meteor Lake beginning to ramp (albeit slowly) and Raptor Lake refresh, while Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) lacks a new CPU.
Meteor Lake only represented ~0.2% of the Intel laptop mix (only one SKU from Acer and one from Asus, 11 total SKUs) after launching in December, consistent with Rolland’s checks that suggested MTL is taking longer to ramp than expected.
Intel took a modest desktop CPU share, up +0.4% sequentially, as Raptor Lake refresh continues to ramp, the analyst writes.
Rolland raised his 2024 PC estimates, with sellthrough up +1.7% year-on-year and ODM notebook builds up +1.3% year-on-year, generally in line with PC TAM expectations from Intel and AMD.
Aftermarket retail GPU prices increased for both Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and AMD, with high-end cards selling above MSRP, and GPU ASPs rose +16.8% sequentially in first-quarter of 2024, the first quarter of price increases since the fourth quarter of 2021, as per the analyst.

Cues From Previous Session:
Rate worries weighed heavily on Tuesday, pushing all major averages down by more than 2%. Tuesday’s data releases, including a rebound in manufacturing activity and in-line job openings, reinforced concerns about a strong economy that could prompt the Fed to raise interest rates more aggressively. The indices opened significantly lower and remained flat for most of the session, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 ending lower for a second consecutive day.
The sell-off was broad-based, with consumer discretionary, healthcare, and real estate stocks leading the decline. Energy stocks, on the other hand, rallied strongly on continued oil price strength, while utility and communication services edged higher. 
The Dow and Nasdaq Composite closed at their lowest points in two weeks, reflecting broader market anxieties.

“Intense competition requires intense diplomacy to manage tensions, address misperceptions and prevent unintended conflict,” the U.S. official said.

Recap Of Last Week’s Market Activity
The week ending on March 22 saw a surge in trading activity after the Federal Reserve signaled its willingness to begin easing monetary policy from current levels. Despite inflation remaining elevated, Fed officials, led by Jerome Powell, hinted at three rate cuts this year. This announcement led to a market recovery, with the tech sector and small-cap stocks notably rebounding. However, as the Fed-related optimism waned towards the end of the week, the indices retreated slightly.

Insights From Analysts:
Louis Navellier, a fund manager, anticipates a potential correction following the strong gains of the first quarter. “Concerns about the market being stretched are inevitable with such strong gains in the first quarter of the year, with a few analysts’ year-end targets already reached,” he said. “We’re overdue for a correction, if only from rebalancing holdings, where the equity exposure has grown beyond the model weight.”
Conversely, Ryan Detrick of Carson Group remains bullish, stating that defensive stocks have yet to lead, a trend typically observed in bearish markets. In a bearish market, “the defensive stuff starts to lead, that’ll be a warning sign,” he said.

Not so, said analysts at Goldman Sachs this week, as earnings growth expectations warrant current lofty share price gains.
While Nvidia returned 522% since the start of 2022 and 84% year-to-date, Goldman analyst Ryan Hammond said the company’s price/earnings ratio was broadly unchanged since the start of 2023 with nearly all its return attributable to a higher stream of earnings.
For the sector, fears of a bubble could be largely discounted, he said. Three-year earnings growth expectations among the largest 10 tech stocks were around 15%, lower than the 24% seen during the tech bubble of 2000, while valuations were at 28x earnings, much lower than the 52x seen in 2000.

The funding is part of the CHIPS and Science Act, a $280 billion package Biden signed into law in 2022.
Biden is expected to announce the award alongside Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo.
Intel announced in October that it had broken ground on a new fabrication plant (fab) at its Ocotillo campus in Chandler, Arizona, where it has plans to build two new fabs with a project price tag of $20 billion.
Reuters reports that Intel’s award will likely include a mix of loans and grants from the government’s $53 billion CHIPS and Science Act fund. It’s also expected to be the biggest award to be granted so far from the 2022 Act, which aims to cut down the U.S.’s dependence on critical technological components imported from abroad.

Both countries have witnessed billions of dollars of investment, with funding from corporate, governmental and institutional investors, driving innovation at breakneck speed.
But has the pace become too quick for China? Its government and delegates at last week’s National People’s Congress say not. 
Bloomberg reporter Sarah Zheng was there last week and spoke to the CEO of 360 Security Technology, who told her: “China's AI companies had developed quickly and basically managed to catch up to OpenAI's ChatGPT capabilities.”
That would suggest that China is roughly on par with the U.S. in terms of AI development.

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), which is the chief backer behind OpenAI, has licensed its partner’s developments in large language models and generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) to take, what many analysts feel, is the leading position in the U.S. AI industry.

On Friday, shareholders experienced a rollercoaster of emotions. Initially, pre-market activity was brisk, propelling the stock up 2.7% at the opening bell, and it continued to climb, reaching a new high of 5.1% above the opening price, setting a record at $974. 
However, the momentum abruptly shifted later in the day. A sudden downturn reversed the stock’s ascent, plunging it to its lowest point at $865.06 — marking a dramatic 11.2% swing from its daily high to the trough.
The shares finished the session at $875.28, a fall of 5.6% from the previous session’s closing mark.

As a provider of key technology needed to develop artificial intelligence (AI) platforms, the company is strategically positioned to benefit from the ongoing AI craze. 
Jensen Huang, Nvidia's co-founder and chief executive, said during the late Wednesday call that ""a whole new industry is being formed, and that's driving our growth."" 
Investors took these words seriously, taking much of the tech sector up.
While big tech companies like Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) compete to find the next groundbreaking stage in AI, companies that provide the infrastructure for those developments are the beneficiaries.
With quarterly revenues of $22.10 billion representing an increase of 265% year-over-year, Nvidia's growth was fueled by rising sales of AI infrastructure such as the H200 chip.
Analysts looking at Nvidia's performance overwhelmingly made mention of the growing market for generative AI as a motor behind the company's recent success, with several analysts raising the company's price target.
Nvidia's success in AI is pushing it close to the 2 trillion market cap, making it the third largest company by that measure. The company's $240 billion jump in market capitalization on Thursday accounts as the largest single-day jump in market history.

Amazon stock tumbled 51% in 2022 but came roaring back more than 100% since the beginning of 2023. Now it’s on deck to join DJIA — the so-called “venerable index.”
As one of Wall Street’s oldest stock indicators, the DJIA doesn’t get shaken up often. The last member to join was Walgreens in 2018 when it replaced  General Electric, which enjoyed a 111-year tenure. Still, membership carries a certain prestige. Or does it?

(NYSE:WMT) rose after the company agreed to buy VIZIO Holding Corp. (NYSE:VZIO) and reported solid quarterly results.
Traders will likely stay cautious ahead of earnings from Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), due Wednesday, as the recent market run-up has been premised on AI-spending that will justify the stretched valuations of tech stocks. “Nvidia's earnings announcement this week and its guidance should signal that the AI dominance will continue,” said fund manager Louis Navellier.  
“Frankly, with 215.8% forecasted sales growth, plus 387.5% forecasted earnings growth, Nvidia is expected to post spectacular quarterly results and issue positive guidance.”
Cues From Past Week’s Trading:
The two inflation reports released last week spooked investors in the week ended Feb. 16, forcing them to revise their odds of a March rate cut. In the process, the major indices, namely the Dow Industrials, the S&P 500 Index, and the Nasdaq Composite snapped their five-week winning run. The only consolidation is that the S&P 500 held the 5,000 level. 
On the other hand, small-cap stocks bucked the downtrend and ended notably higher for the week.

Strong Ramp-Up: AI chip demand is likely to ramp up steadily in the first half of 2024 before accelerating further in the second half, said analyst Vijay Rakesh in a note. 
Ahead of Nvidia Corp.’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) quarterly results, due on Feb. 21, and Broadcom, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AVGO), due on March 7, channel checks revealed tight supplies of former’s H100 AI accelerator chipset despite lead times contracting. 
That said, “overall demand far outstrips supply,” the analyst said.
The analyst also noted that original design manufacturer Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) said demand was up 40% from the second half of 2023, potentially reflecting AI ramps. 
Nvidia’s impending B100 launch bodes well for the company’s 2024 guidance, he added.
Nvidia teased the new B100 Blackwell graphics processor last year. The company will reportedly more than double the performance of the newly announced H200.

(NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). The group saw its combined worth surpass the total economic output of global cities such as New York, Tokyo, London, Los Angeles, London, Paris, Seoul, Chicago, San Francisco, Osaka and Shanghai, as highlighted by Michael Hartnett, Bank of America’s chief market strategist, in a recent note.
The stocks are now testing the “law of physics,” Bloomberg columnists John Authers and Isabelle Lee wrote on Monday. Ed Yardeni, a popular Wall Street industry veteran, said “the Mag-7 once again are sucking all the air out of the universe,” in a recent note addressing the spectacular jump of Meta Platforms.
Last Friday, the social media giant owned by Mark Zuckerberg made a historic $204-billion market value jump in a single day, the largest for any U.S. company ever.

The Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) price index — also known as the Fed’s favorite inflation gauge — held steady at 2.6% year-on-year in December 2023, remaining at the lowest levels in nearly three years. Simultaneously, personal spending figures significantly exceeded economist projections, growing by 0.7% month-over-month, leading to doubts about whether the strong economy might deter the Fed from rushing to cut interest rates.
Short-term Treasury yields ticked higher, with the two-year note yield jumping back to 4.35%, weighing on rate-sensitive sectors.

Needham On Intel
Analyst Quinn Bolton downgraded the rating from Buy to Hold.
Intel unexpectedly reset its first-quarter earnings guidance and its core data center segment continues to face challenges, Bolton said in a note.
“After a string of success, it seems the easy part of the turnaround may be over,” the analyst wrote. “We view higher valuation, lower revenue/EPS estimates, increasing competition (in core and non-core markets), and distant IFS revenue all contributing to a tough road ahead,” he added.

Negative reactions to earnings reports, particularly from various tech stocks, have the potential to exert pressure on the market. Of greater significance is the impending release of crucial inflation data, likely to influence the Federal Reserve’s rate decision scheduled for Wednesday.
The futures market has priced in a 97.4% probability of steady rates at the upcoming meeting, the CME FedWatch Tool showed. However, bond market activity suggests traders are beginning to factor in the possibility of rate cuts throughout the year.
Cues From Thursday's Trading:
Thursday witnessed a positive start in U.S. stocks, propelled by a government report revealing stronger-than-expected growth in the U.S. economy for the fourth quarter. Concurrently, jobless claims exceeded expectations, and durable goods orders stagnated, missing projections. Core order growth slightly surpassed expectations. Another report indicated higher-than-expected new home sales in December.
As traders digested this data and responded to varied earnings results, the major indices maintained a solid position in the morning session. However, by mid-session, the S&P 500 Index hovered just below the unchanged line, while the Dow Industrials and Nasdaq Composite briefly dipped below. In the afternoon, the major indices reversed course, concluding the day in positive territory.
Thursday’s upward movement propelled the Dow Industrials into record territory, with the S&P 500 Index securing a record high for the fifth consecutive session. Advancements were observed in a majority of S&P 500 sectors, particularly IT services, energy, communication services, and utility stocks, while healthcare and consumer discretionary stocks experienced declines.

Cues From Wednesday's Trading:
U.S. stocks closed with a mixed performance on Wednesday, as the Dow Industrials moved further away from its all-time highs, while the S&P 500 marked its fourth consecutive all-time closing high. The varied sentiment unfolded as traders absorbed a positive quarterly report from Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and better-than-expected private sector activity data. The subdued sentiment might be attributed to concerns ahead of key economic data scheduled for release on Thursday and Friday.
Strength in the communication services sector, led by Netflix, along with gains in energy stocks, helped offset weakness in utility, real estate, material, consumer staples, and financial stocks.

With semiconductor units down 20% year-on-year in 2023, he noted that the worst unit correction in 22 years is almost through the inventory correction. 
While Danely expects more estimate cuts to the analog companies due to the auto and industrial correction (combined 30% of semi-TAM), the analyst noted these cuts are getting smaller, and should trough in the first half of fiscal 2024.
Danely is most positive on DRAM and reiterated Micron Technology, Inc (NASDAQ:MU) as his top pick, given his expected 50% year-on-year increase in DRAM pricing in 2024. 
Danely’s other Buy-rated names include Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), Microchip Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MCHP), AVGO, Analog Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:ADI), ON Semiconductor Corp (NASDAQ:ON), Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM), and GlobalFoundries Inc (NASDAQ:GFS).
Micron’s price target of $95 reflects DRAM upturn. AMD’s price target of $136 builds on PC recovery, server share gains and AI success. 
Broadcom’s price target of $1,100 took into account the company being an AI beneficiary, EPS accretion from VMWare. 
Microchip’s $100 price target builds upon bottoming of consensus EPS estimates. Qualcomm’s $160 price target attracted attention courtesy of wireless inventory replenishment and share gains at Samsung. 
Analog Devices’ price target of $210 gained attention as one of the most defensive name with bottoming consensus EPS estimates. On Semiconductor’s $85 price target reflected silicon carbide offsetting some of the downturn. GlobalFoundries’ $70 price target got a callout for restructuring initiatives offsetting semiconductor downturn.

At the CES technology trade show, Nvidia, a U.S. company, has maintained its lead in this market since last year. 
The company revealed three new GPUs – RTX 4060 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4080 Super – designed for AI-ready laptops, the Nikkei Asia reports. 
These chips are featured in Acer, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Samsung models. Nvidia’s AI chips, including the high-end A100 and H100 models, have gained traction, particularly with the rise of generative AI, like ChatGPT. 
However, their top chips face U.S. export restrictions to China, though the newly announced GPUs are exempt from these curbs.
In contrast, AMD and Intel are betting on AI personal computers (PCs), which embed AI chips for local AI model processing. 
This strategy differs from Nvidia’s focus on server-based AI, relying on data centers. 
At CES, both companies unveiled processors specifically for AI PCs. These chips feature a dedicated neural processing unit (NPU), offering enhanced data privacy, longer battery life, and expanded AI applications compared to regular PCs.
Despite this innovation, Intel and AMD acknowledge that widespread consumer adoption of AI PCs may ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","News,Analyst Ratings,Tech,Media"

Traders are approaching the market with caution, evaluating the gains from the previous session. The upcoming days hold several crucial catalysts, with the focus shifting to the Wednesday release of the consumer price inflation report and Friday’s eagerly anticipated big bank earnings.
Despite the cautious mood, potential factors like a billion-dollar tech merger and the swirling optimism around a spot Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) exchange-traded fund approval, coupled with the spike in oil prices, could inject some buying activity.
Cues From Monday’s Trading:
Monday witnessed a robust advancement in U.S. stocks, driven by a strong rebound in the technology sector, lifting the broader market. Both the S&P 500 Index and the Nasdaq Composite started on a positive note, steadily gaining momentum throughout the session and closing with substantial increases.
The Dow Industrials, comprising 30 stocks, initially faced a setback, primarily due to Boeing Co. (NYSE:BA) dragging down the index. This followed federal regulators’ recommendation to ground 737 Max 9s after an Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE:ALK) plane experienced a midflight blowout. However, the index managed to recover from the early dip and concluded with a modest gain. Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC), Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), and Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) spearheaded the rebound in the Dow.

The analyst noted that while semiconductor content increases in automobiles are a clear trend, supply has generally caught up to demand. 
Shorter lead times, increasing inventory, higher interest rates, and rising sticker prices are causing a demand slowdown. The analyst flagged that this slower demand environment is continuing.
Cassidy expected to learn some details on the current automotive market at CES this week. 
The analyst will meet with companies with automotive exposure, including Ambarella, Innoviz, Navitas, onsemi, Qualcomm, and Synaptics. 
Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ: QCOM) has been aggressively updating its Snapdragon XR Platform for many years. 
Cassidy noted Qualcomm as being the leader in virtual reality SoCs. 
Qualcomm's advantage is the pricing, technology, and ecosystem of support leveraged from the Snapdragon core design refined over years of high-volume production in handsets. 
The virtual reality headset market will eventually find the correct feature set that meets consumers' needs, as per Cassidy.
Arm Holdings Plc's (NASDAQ: ARM) licensing pipeline for generative AI licenses is strengthening based on Cassidy's checks in Asia and Silicon Valley in December, which is additive to the already rich v9 architecture roadmap, share gains in PC, DC, and significant royalty rate increases complemented by the new CSS program.

With the Federal Reserve pouring cold water on the market’s hope for expeditious rate cuts, the mood will likely revert to data-dependency. Against the backdrop, investors could remain keyed in on the day’s two labor market reports on private payrolls and jobless claims. Wednesday’s JOLTS survey results showed that job openings came in slightly below expectations in November. 
The spotlight will be on small-cap stocks as they plummeted on Wednesday. Traders may also watch the spike in crude oil prices and the uptick seen in bond yields. 
Cues From Wednesday's Trading:
The FOMC minutes released Wednesday served to intensify the uncertainty surrounding the rate outlook and aggravated the weakness seen in the market in the recent sessions. 
The Fed meeting minutes were ”another attempt by the Fed to walk back some of the overly-dovish interpretation of the December FOMC meeting,” said  Allianz Investment Management Senior Investment Strategist Charlie Ripley.
“At the end of the day, the Fed believes market conditions may have gotten ahead of themselves and minutes moving expectations back as the probability of a March rate cut continues to decline,” he added.
The major averages opened lower and continued to move roughly sideways at depressed levels before closing notably lower for the session.

Is this a sign of a strained market with valuations running too hot and prompting investors to take profits?
Bank of America said it remained bullish on the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) for 2024, despite its 65% gain in 2023.
The iShares Semiconductor ETF (NYSE:SOXX), an exchange traded fund that tracks the Philly Semiconductor Index, fell 5.4% over the past two sessions but, like the index it tracks, was up 65% in 2023.

“The key question for investors,” said BofA analyst Vivek Arya, “is whether 2024 will bring more of the same, or rotation into last year’s laggards.”

Interestingly, not all segments of the equity market were equally affected by this early-year turbulence. Value-related stocks managed to weather the storm, avoiding losses and even posting modest gains during the first trading session of the year.

The market was closed on Monday for the Christmas holiday. Extended slide in bond yields, M&A news flow, and positive expectations concerning monetary policy could keep the momentum going for the market. A duo of house price data due for the day will unlikely create much ripples in the market.
Cues From Past Week's Trading:

(NASDAQ:MU) reporting above-consensus earnings and guiding strongly, while Nike, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) was disappointed with its quarterly report.
All three major averages are trading just shy of their two-year highs.

The dollar has long been regarded as a safe-haven asset. Keeping investments tied up in dollar assets during times of market upheaval has been among the classic “risk-off” trades, along with gold.
And the reverse is also true, as BofA analyst Adarsh Sinha indicated — saying most of the dollar sell-off has been down to the equity market rally, which saw the S&P 500 index climb 10.5% since Oct. 27 as investors have become more bullish on risk.

Is this telling us that when it’s bad for the VIX it’s good for stocks?
Analysts have written volumes on how to interpret the VIX, or the CBOE’s Volatility Index, and sometimes called the Wall Street “fear gauge.” Generally, it is seen as a measure of market volatility. The higher it moves, the higher the level of uncertainty in the equity markets, whereas equities tend to thrive when it is at its lowest points.
On Monday, the VIX moved a little higher — up 2.5% at 12.77 — but this remained well below its long-term average around 20. At its high in 2023 it peaked at 30, during the early days of the pandemic it spiked to 85.

Treasury yields fell, as investors flocked to fixed income. The 10-year yields erased Wednesday’s uptick, settling at 4.45%.

(NASDAQ:AMD) reported Tuesday after the market close with third-quarter earnings and revenue that came in ahead of expectations. The guidance for the fourth quarter was roughly in line with estimates, sending the stock lower in after-hours trading.
AMD’s Key Q3 Numbers
AMD reported third-quarter non-GAAP earnings  per share, or EPS, of 70 cents, up 4% from the year-ago earnings per share of 67 cents. The bottom line climbed 21% from the second quarter’s 58 cents per share.
Analysts, on average, had modeled EPS of 64 cents for the quarter. 
The Santa Clara, California-based company grew its revenue 4% year-over-year from $5.62 billion in the third quarter of 2022 to $5.8 billion in the third quarter of 2023. It also topped the consensus estimate of $5.27 billion. Sequentially, the top line grew 8% from $5.36 billion in the second quarter. 
In early August, AMD guided third-quarter revenue to be approximately $5.7 billion plus or minus $300 million. The company penciled in the non-GAAP gross margin at about 51% compared to the previous quarter’s 50% and year-ago’s 54%. ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","News,Analyst Color,Earnings,Equities,Top Stories,Markets,Tech"

(NASDAQ:AMD) is scheduled to report its third-quarter results Tuesday after the market closes. Expectations are muted, given the multiple headwinds that are impacting demand.
What Wall Street Expects
Analysts, on average, estimate AMD to report third-quarter non-GAAP earnings per share, or EPS, of 64 cents, down 4.5% from 67 cents in the year-ago quarter.
The Santa Clara, California-based company beat earnings estimates in each of the past three quarters and reported a miss ahead of them.
Revenue is estimated at $5.37 billion, representing a 4.4% year-over-year decline from the year-ago quarter’s $5.62 billion. In the second quarter, the top line was at $5.36 billion.
KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh is modeling in line with slightly higher results, driven by improving PC demand and troughing server demand, along with normalizing Milan server processor chip inventory at Cloud Service providers.  Raymond James’ Srini Pajjuri called for a slight third-quarter upside, as PC tracked slightly better, and the Data Center tracked in line.
If rival Intel Corp.’s (NASDAQ:INTC) quarterly results are anything to go by, a double beat is likely in the cards for AMD as well. Intel’s third-quarter EPS and revenue came in at 41 cents and $14.16 billion, ahead of the consensus estimates of 22 cents and $13.57 billion, respectively.

The analyst expects AMD to deliver in-line 3Q23 earnings results on mixed-end market trends with more robust data center and PC CPU dynamics, offset by weaker enterprise, embedded, and PC gaming.
Mosesmann sees a more robust 4Q23 outlook above consensus expectations as data center CPU share gains continue to accelerate (amid inventory normalization), a return to gaming seasonality that offsets embedded weakness and console weak seasonality.
Mosesmann expects AMD to strike a bullish posture in all strategic product areas, including the new MI300A/X APU/GPU compute accelerators, which he sees as much more competitive than the Street believes. 
AMD is installing MI300A into the El Capitan supercomputer for the LLNL and the MI300X (sampling) to ramp early in 2024 in volume in the discrete GPU accelerator segment vs. Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA) Hopper and Intel Corp (NASDAQ: INTC) Gaudi 2/3.

That said, data suggests S&P 500 companies may be on track to break a fourth-quarter earnings-declining streak. 
A Mixed Bag Laced With Caution: Last week, Investors reacted to disappointing earnings reports from some high-profile companies such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG). The former spooked investors with softer-than-expected cloud revenue and the latter with its cautious guidance. 
Two of the fellow “Magnificent Seven,” namely Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) calmed investors’ nerves, either with stellar results or positive commentary regarding the near term. Chip earnings were also a mixed bag, with Texas Instruments, Inc. (NASDAQ:TXN) reporting a third-quarter miss, while Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC) cheered investors with a solid beat and positive outlook.
Energy giants Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX) reported below-consensus earnings for the quarter, and this served as a drag on the profit growth of S&P 500 companies.
Midway into the season, about 49% of the S&P 500 companies have released their earnings so far, with 78% of the companies reporting earnings beats and 62% ringing in revenue upside, data from FactSet shows.
The year-over-year blended earnings growth rate of S&P 500 companies is expected at 2.7%, potentially marking the first growth since the third quarter of 2022.
Earnings Deluge Awaits:  The tech earnings news flow continues in the unfolding week, with the likes of Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) on tap. A slew of SMID-cap companies are also scheduled to disclose their quarterly earnings scorecard.

The Week That Was: The blended year-over-year earnings of S&P 500 companies are expected to decrease by 0.4%, marking the fourth consecutive decline, according to Factset’s weekly earnings insights report. The decline in earnings is largely due to downward revisions in earnings per share (EPS) estimates for Pfizer, Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and Eli Lilly & Co. (NYSE:LLY).
Some of the notable disappointments from the past week include Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Nokia Oyj (NYSE:NOK), Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS), and Alcoa Corp. (NYSE:AA), among others. Additionally, there were negative preannouncements from companies like Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. (NYSE:HPE) and SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG).
Factset data indicates that out of the 17% of the S&P 500 companies that have reported so far, 73% have reported positive earnings per share (EPS) surprises, and 66% have reported positive revenue surprises.
The Week Ahead: With earnings from the financial sector tapering, tech companies are expected to take the spotlight this week. Investors will closely monitor earnings from communication services companies such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), along with software giant Microsoft Corporation (NYSE:MSFT) and e-commerce giant Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).

Intel shared plans to spin off its Programmable Solutions Group business as a standalone business, giving it flexibility for accelerated growth and helping it to compete more effectively. The move is more tactical than strategic, as Intel is cash-starved, the analyst writes.
Intel mismanaged Altera early on and has only recently begun a reinvestment and focus initiative likely related to the spinoff angle.
The 2-3 year timeline suggests Altera is not strong enough today to be standalone. Otherwise, they would have sold the unit. 
The analyst wonders if Altera will shift foundry services back to TSMC. Altera made that ill-fated shift from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd (NYSE: TSM) to Intel 14nm before the Intel acquisition.
The Altera leadership within Intel is non-Altera (Intel), which is not a knock but an angle that does not inspire.
Intel has a tough road ahead. The Street may applaud the IPO spiel, but the fundamentals do not change.

The ADP National Employment Report, which fell short of expectations (89,000 vs. 153,000), provided a welcome respite, alleviating pressure on bond rates. 
Additionally, a significant drop in gasoline demand in the U.S. last week acted as a substantial deterrent to oil prices, which tumbled by 4.5%, weighing down energy stocks. 
Services sector activity moderated its pace of growth in September, in line with expectations, as evidenced by the latest ISM Services PMI readout.

The Nvidia Thesis: Following KeyBanc’s quarterly supply chain checks, Vinh reported that while China’s demand remained weak, it didn’t deteriorate significantly. 
Some recovery was observed in the PC and smartphone markets, according to Vinh. Inventory destocking in the channel showed progress. The AI data center demand remained exceptionally strong, outpacing supply by approximately 20% due to limited chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) capacity.

Many economists now assert that the Federal Reserve’s intentions to maintain interest rates in the upcoming week are virtually sealed, with market sentiment indicating a probability of no September rate hike exceeding 94%. However, the outlook for the November meeting remains shrouded in mystery, with the likelihood of a rate hike hovering around 43%.
Let’s delve into how five prominent ETFs responded immediately following the release of the CPI report on Wednesday.

Auto Worker Strike Likely
Please click here for a chart of General Motors Co (NYSE: GM).
Note the following:

The Morning Capsule is about the big picture, not an individual stock. The chart of GM stock is being used to illustrate the point.
The chart shows that GM stock has given up all of its summer rally gains. The reason is a potential strike by United Auto Workers (UAW).
President Biden claims to be the most pro-union president. President Biden has been predicting that UAW will not strike.
In The Arora Report analysis, the probability of a UAW strike is very high.
UAW President Shawn Fain is talking about the possibility of a simultaneous strike against GM, Ford Motor Co (NYSE: F), and Stellantis NV (NYSE: STLA).
In The Arora Report analysis, if there is a simultaneous strike against all three automakers, it will put Michigan in a recession and will have a major negative impact on the U.S. economy.  
The union is especially upset that new plants such as those for batteries are not unionized.
UAW is blaming the Biden administration for giving away billions of dollars of subsidies without demanding wage standards.
All of the foregoing is positive for Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) as Tesla is not unionized.
On August 29, we shared with you:

Today, Tesla (TSLA) is turning on a massive NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA) cluster consisting of 10,000 H100 GPUs. The cluster will be used to train FSD (Full Self-Driving). Tesla is also spending $1B to build its own Dojo supercomputer.


There is heavy buying in TSLA stock in the early trade as a Wall Street bank highlights Dojo and states that Dojo can add up to $500B in value to Tesla.
The momo crowd’s pattern is to buy ahead of events, ignoring the risk. The reason is that the momo crowd believes that every event that is ahead is going to run up the stock market. In the early trade, the momo crowd is aggressively buying stocks ahead of several events.

CPI will be released on September 13 at 8:30am ET, followed by PPI on September 14 at 8:30am ET.

AMD’s Q2 Headline Numbers: For the second quarter that ended June 30, 2023, AMD reported non-GAAP earnings per share of 58 cents, ahead of the consensus estimate of 52 cents per share. 
The bottom-line number was down 44.76% from the year-ago quarter’s $1.05 per share and 3.33% lower than the first quarter’s 60 cents per share.

The chipmaker has beat bottom-line expectations in three of the past four quarters.
The consensus revenue expectation for the quarter is $4.81 billion, down 26.50% year-over-year and 11% lower than in the previous.
In early May, AMD guided second-quarter revenue to $5.3 billion, plus or minus $300 million.
In a recent note, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann said that he expects AMD to report in-line second-quarter results. He sees the quarter as a transition period leading into a second half with multiple growth drivers.

The latest earnings season is setting new records for the presence of AI in management speeches during earnings calls, a new report says. 
Mentions of AI during the latest earnings season were higher than ever during the second quarter, surpassing the records set in the first, Reuters reports Monday. 
Google Puts Pedal To The Medal On AI: Google parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has so far been the firm to mention the term the most, with 62 mentions on last week's call. It's not surprising the company is deciding to double down on an AI-rich narrative. 
Google recently had its dominance over web search put into question by competitor Microsoft, which has included ChatGPT within its search engine Bing since February. Google quickly fired back by rushing the release of Bard, its own AI-powered chatbot.
Surprisingly, Alphabet's mentions of AI surpassed those of its first-quarter meeting, which was held in the midst of the race with Bing, and amounted to 52 mentions. AI investment is being quickly made in other corners of the company's operations, integrating generative AI technology into its ads business and cloud products.

Rainy day funds at America’s biggest banks might be getting bigger.


Under new rules proposed by US regulators, banks with over $100 billion in assets would need to raise their capital requirements by ~20%.


The bigger the bank, the bigger the requirement.


The goal is to mitigate operational risk across activities like lending, trading, and so on.


Banks oppose the move, naturally, arguing the measures are extreme and would prove more costly than expected, ultimately hurting consumers.



To quote Fed Chair Powell, the labor market is “very tight”.


Last week’s data did nothing to change that with initial jobless claims falling well below expectations to their lowest in 5 months.


And workers aren’t staying unemployed for long as continuing claims dropped to the fewest in 6 months.


Another sign that demand for labor remains high? Close to 5% of job postings in the US feature a signing bonus
That’s more than 2x the pre-pandemic average of 1.8%, according to Indeed.



For an economy feared to be on the brink of a recession, the US looks to be full steam ahead.


After growing at a 2% pace in the first 3 months of the year, GDP expanded at 2.4% in Q2, crushing expectations of 1.8%.


Highlighting the print was the largest growth in business spending in 6 quarters.


Personal consumption also outpaced estimates, showing resilience among consumers.


Meanwhile, core PCE prices—which the Fed watches closely—fell more than expected to 3.8% (vs. 4% est).

What Happened: The PCE report for June, issued by the Bureau of Economic Analysis on Friday, indicated that the annual rate of underlying inflation came in a 4.1% compared to economist projections of 4.2%, giving investors reason to believe that the most intense period of price pressure is in the rearview mirror.
Economists shared their thoughts on the PCE data and its potential implications.
Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management Group, believes that the softer-than-expected PCE data could be the trigger for the market to hit new highs, especially after the stronger than expected GDP and positive earnings season.

Nearly all FOMC participants anticipated it would be reasonable to raise interest rates somewhat more by year’s end, Powell said, stressing that the decision to pause hikes doesn’t mean the end of tightening. 
The market slide was spurred by the negative performance from tech titans, with Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) down 4.5%, 2.4% and 2.3%, respectively.
FedEx Corp. (NYSE:FDX) reported slightly better-than-anticipated earnings, but missed revenue estimates and provided disappointing guidance for the upcoming quarters.
Earlier in the day, markets negatively reacted to a hotter-than-expected U.K. inflation rate in May, which fueled expectations for more aggressive Bank of England rate hikes. 
Traders increased their expectations for a 25-basis-point Fed rate hike in July, from 62% last week to 79% today. This shift caused U.S. Treasury yields to move higher during the session. 
Cues From Wednesday’s Trading:
The S&P 500 Index fell 0.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index lost 170 points or 1.1% for the day. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average held steady, while small caps in the Russell 2000 had a timid 0.1% drop.

The resurgence was fueled by an AI-driven rally, sparked by Nvidia Corp's (NASDAQ: NVDA) impressive 27% surge after posting stellar quarterly earnings.
The move higher came despite traders raising their expectations for a Fed rate hike by July and debt ceiling talks still failing to produce a final deal.
House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said that negotiators had made some progress on a debt limit deal and that a solution may be reached soon, although issues remain. According to a Wall Street Journal report, the Biden administration is preparing a contingency strategy to deal with U.S. federal agencies' payments beyond the debt limit deadline.
On the data front, the labor market continued to show signs of strength as jobless claims for last week fell short of expectations, while both the GDP and core PCE inflation have been revised higher for the first quarter.
Meanwhile, money markets' implied expectations for Fed interest rate hikes are increasing, with the latest CME Group Fedwatch tool assigning a nearly 50% likelihood of a June increase and a nearly 85% probability of a 25-basis-point hike by July. 
Cues From Thursday’s Trading: 
On Thursday, the tech sector emerged as the top performer, with the Nasdaq 100 Index climbing 2.3%. This surge was driven by investors' fear of missing out (FOMO) on the ""AI rally.""
The S&P 500 Index was 0.6% higher, while the Dow Jones fell 0.3%. Small caps in the Russell 2000 index were falling 1.3% lower.

Analyst Color: 
Tuesday’s pullback could have been due to pre-Fed jitters, said Carson Group’s Ryan Detrick. The analyst said he sees a silver lining in the cloud.
Giving his takeaways from Tuesday's move, he said stocks finished well off their lows, the equity put/call ratio spiked big and cryptocurrencies did quite well.
A note sent by JPMorgan’s trading desk weighed in on four scenarios for the Fed meeting and the likely market move in each of the situations, Bloomberg reported. Analysts from the firm expect:

up to a 2.5% rally if the Fed cut rates, although the probability of such a verdict is less than 1%
up to a 1.5% rally if the Fed pauses and the probability of such a move is 5%
A 0.5%-1% rally if the Fed hikes and signals a pause; the probability of such a decision is 55%.
A 0.75%-1.25% retreat of the Fed hikes and signals more rate hikes to come, with the probability of such a move being ...","News,Earnings,Equities,Previews,Small Cap,Top Stories,Economics,Federal Reserve,Markets,Trading Ideas"

The Fed’s favorite inflation gauge — the core price consumption expenditure index — came in at 4.6% in March, down from the 4.7% a month earlier but slightly above expectations of 4.5%.
Despite this potentially dampening expectations for Fed rate cuts in the near future, investors continue to exhibit a strong level of risk appetite. 
Cues From Friday's Trading: 
The major averages were higher on Friday, except for the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, which was flat on the day. 
The S&P 500 gained 0.6%, the Dow Industrial Average was up 0.7% and small caps in the Russell 2000 soared 1.1%.

Wedbush On Intel
Analyst Matt Bryson upgraded the rating from Underperform to Neutral, while raising the price target from $20 to $30.
The first quarter was “something of a mixed bag” for Intel, Bryson said in the upgrade note. “INTC revenues and sales guidance certainly exceeded our revenue and EPS expectations despite some greater than expected headwinds in the general data center market,” he wrote.
“Conversely, GMs missed our prior expectation and are now expected to dip even further in CQ2 to 37.5%,” the analyst wrote. There is no “significant negative near-term catalyst on the horizon,” he added.

In its first meeting under new governor Kazuo Ueda, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) decided to keep interest rates ultra-low.


As expected, the central bank kept its yield curve control policy unchanged.


It also scrapped guidance and announced a plan to review past monetary policy, setting the stage for future policy changes.


The yen fell sharply on the announcement while government bonds reversed course higher.



Pending home sales in the US dropped unexpectedly in March, falling by 5.2%.


It was the largest decline since September.


Inventory is failing to keep up with demand as homeowners with low mortgage rates remain reluctant to sell.



The US economy expanded at a slower pace than expected in the first quarter with GDP rising just 1.1%.


Despite the strongest increase in consumer spending (3.7%) in 2 years, a sharp decline in business investment and a drop in inventories were a drag on growth.


Meanwhile, the personal consumption expenditures index—the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation—increased by 4.2% (from 3.9% in Q4), well above the central bank’s 2% target.



Stocks
Cost-cutting measures across US companies continue by way of layoffs.


After laying off 700 workers in November, Lyft announced it will eliminate over 1,000 additional jobs (~26% of its workforce).


Dropbox said it plans to cut 500 jobs (~16% of employees) to combat slowing growth and economic headwinds.


Gap Inc—which cut 500 corporate positions in September—said it would eliminate another 1,800 jobs as a part of a broad restructuring to become more nimble.

Analyst Color: Despite worries concerning a potential recession, companies have shown profit growth. “The most important consideration is that while recession fears are still very much discussed, there is no earnings recession in the cards yet,” said fund manager Louis Navellier. 
He also noted that food companies are increasing prices, which could turn out to be negative for inflation expectations. The stalemate over raising the debt ceiling also kept traders on the sidelines, he noted. Since then, the House has passed a bill to raise the ceiling, but it remains to be seen whether President Joe Biden will approve the legislation, given his disagreement over the spending cuts that were included as part of the bill.

Speaker Kevin McCarthy passed his debt limit bill through the House yesterday…barely.


The vote was 217-215 in favor, with all Democrats (and four Republicans) opposing the measures.


The bill now heads to the Democratic-controlled Senate where it has virtually no chance of passing.



Federal prosecutors believe Jack Teixeira—the Massachusetts guardsman charged with leaking highly-classified intelligence documents—may still have access to sensitive material.


He is accused of attempting to cover up his tracks by destroying computer equipment, urging others to delete messages, and instructing them not to talk to investigators.


Authorities also say they found a cache of weapons at two homes used by Teixeira, which included handguns, rifles, shotguns, an AK-style high-capacity weapon, and a literal bazooka.



Orders for US durable goods jumped by 3.2% in March, easily topping market expectations of a 0.7% increase.


Much of that gain, however, is attributable to a surge in new contracts for passenger planes.


Stripping out transportation, core goods rose by just 0.3% in March and posted the slowest annual gain in over 3 years.


Meanwhile, business investment (red) fell for the 4th time in 5 months and points to a slowing economy.



Stocks
On their way to fresh all-time lows, shares of First Republic Bank were halted several times over the last 2 sessions.


The lender has floated a new rescue plan to the 11 banks which rescued it in the first place.


The plan involves selling them new loans or stock (or both) above market value.

TSMC reported earnings per share of $1.31 per ADR, up 2.1% Y/Y and down 30% Q/Q, above the consensus of $1.20 due to its cost control measures.
Also, only 90nm, 65nm, and 28nm revenues did not fall sequentially in 1Q23, likely due to automotive that leverages those nodes being the only bright spot at the moment.

Easing worries about a broader financial crisis continue to spur risk appetite among investors, while applications for unemployment benefits rose somewhat more than expected last week, assisting in maintaining Fed rate expectations roughly steady.
Tech continued to outperform other sectors, with the Nasdaq 100 index officially entering a bull market.
Cues From Thursday's Trading: 
The S&P 500 index rose 0.4% on the day, hitting an intraday high of 4,056 points, the highest since March 6, when the stock market started to plummet on rising banking fears.
The Nasdaq composite added nearly 100 points or 0.75%, breaking above the psychological 12,000 mark. 
The Dow Jones Industrial average was slightly more muted, slightly up by 0.2%.

“While higher rates have already wreaked havoc on an overheated housing market and an overextended banking sector, corporate borrowers are going to continue to feel the sting,” said Daniel Berkowitz, investment director at Prudent Management Associates.
The analyst said the pandemic allowed companies to enjoy debt on extremely favorable terms. As this debt matures over the next few years, companies will likely have to refinance at potentially materially higher rates, he said. Higher interest expense, the analyst said, might drag down corporate earnings and put pressure on market prices.

Microsoft’s commentary on the earnings call worried the market, which is so intensely concerned about economic growth, LPL Financial chief global strategist Quincy Crosby  said in a note. The message from Microsoft’s management was “the economy is slowing, and their customers are more cautious about spending,” the analyst said.
“There’s still a long way to go during the reporting season, but guidance is becoming even more important than it was before last night’s Microsoft earnings call,” he added.

What Happened: China headwinds associated with the slowing economy and reopening portend a choppy chip earnings season ahead, KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh  said in a note.
JPMorgan analysts say the semiconductor industry has always had structural supports in place but cyclical forces challenged it in 2022. Chipmakers had to contend with the most aggressive Fed rate hiking cycle in decades and bloated inventories, China’s zero-COVID-19 policy and fragile U.S.-China relations.

The first glimpse into how the fourth-quarter earnings season would shape up for chip stocks could be gleaned from the quarterly reports of Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) and Texas Instruments Inc. (NASDAQ: TXN).
Texas Instruments Likely To Guide Below Consensus: Texas Instruments is due to report its fourth-quarter results on Tuesday after the market close.
Analysts, on average, expect the company to report earnings per share of $1.98, down from $2.27 in the year-ago period. The top line may have slipped 4.40% to $4.62 billion.

The major U.S. averages closed Thursday’s session on a mixed note, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite indices declining sharply, while the Dow Industrials bucked the downtrend. While earnings reports from a couple of Dow components propped up the blue-chip average, earnings also proved to be the undoing of the tech-heavy Nasdaq index.
Traders also reacted to advance third-quarter GDP report, which showed quicker-than-expected growth.
“The U.S. is not currently in recession, given the strength of the consumer sector,” Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial said. Excluding more volatile categories, the growth trajectory looks weak, he added.
“A deteriorating housing market and nagging inflation along with an aggressive Federal Reserve put the economy on unsure footing for 2023,” the economist said, adding that the markets have possibly priced in much of the near-term recession risks.
