RBC Capital Markets: While ""not a clean quarter relative to expectations,"" Palo Alto Networks' underlying momentum improved, Hedberg said. Although billings missed expectations, this metric ""is becoming less relevant to the underlying tone of the business,"" he added.
The company appears ""well-positioned to consolidate security spend and to maintain above-peer growth,"" the analyst wrote. ""Management noted strong bookings and backlog growth as well as stable cybersecurity demand trends provided the confidence to raise the midpoint of FY/24 guidance,"" he further stated.

""We expect greater deferred payments to continue to pressure billings for the next several quarters, or at least until PANW starts to lap its consolidation initiative in the January FY25 quarter,"" the analyst wrote.

(NASDAQ:META) are being compounded by weaker-than-expected economic growth and higher inflationary pressures last quarter, raising fears of a stagflation phase for the U.S. economy.
The U.S. economy grew by a 1.6% annualized pace in Q1 2024, slowing down sharply from the 3.4% pace in the previous quarter and missing expectations of a growth rate of 2.5%. Inflation, as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) price index, substantially accelerated from a 1.8% to 3.4% annualized pace, with the underlying measure of core PCE escalating to 3.7%.

Cues From Past Session:
Early optimism triggered by positive reactions to earnings from Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Texas Instruments, Inc. (NASDAQ:TXN) tempered over the course of Wednesday’s session. Mixed earnings reports and economic worries kept sentiment subdued for much of the session, and this led to a mixed close for the day.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 Index ended the session marginally higher, pulling notably off the day’s high reached in early trading. The former moved in a roughly 205-point range and the latter gyrated between 5,047.02 and 5,089.48, a roughly 43-point intra-day move.

The major indices opened higher and rose in early trading before moving roughly sideways for the remainder of the session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed for a fourth straight session and settled at a two-week high, while the Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 Index notched up their second straight session of gains.

A lot is riding on the earnings reports of companies like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (GOOG).
The Season So Far: The percentage of S&P 500 companies that have reported positive earning surprises and the magnitude of earnings surprises are at or above their 10-year averages, said FactSet in its report released Friday. That said, substantial downward revisions to earnings per share (EPS) estimates of two healthcare companies have led to a decline in earnings growth over the past two weeks.
The combined earnings per share growth rate of S&P 500 companies, considering both the already reported actual results and the estimates for those yet to report, is at 0.5%, according to FactSet. The metric, however, fell from the 0.9% estimated previous week and the 3.4% estimated at the end of the first quarter. Earnings growth for the quarter may extend the positive growth streak to three quarters.
So far, 14% of the S&P 500 companies have reported March quarter results. 
See Also: Best Tech Stocks To Buy Right Now
Look Ahead: The upcoming week will likely feature earnings releases from 158 S&P 500 companies, including 11 Dow 30 components. With the bank earnings tapering off, the spotlight shifts to tech companies, as they begin to roll out their quarterly scorecard this week.
Apart from some big techs, which are part of the group called the “Magnificent Seven,” homebuilders, defense contractors, airlines and transportation companies are also due to release their quarterly reports. 
All eyes are focused on Tesla as analysts expect a downbeat report from the company. Analysts see the scope of a further contraction in margin and potentially a double miss yet again in the first quarter.

About 80% of the planned reduction was targeted at the Enterprise Operations & Support and Q2C missions, Finance & Operations, the report said.

The Seattle-based e-commerce giant is replacing pharmacy company Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA). In recent years, Walgreens has seen its shares plummet 28.4% in 2022; 30.1% in 2023; and 14.6% in 2024.
Amazon stock tumbled 51% in 2022 but came roaring back more than 100% since the beginning of 2023. Now it’s on deck to join DJIA — the so-called “venerable index.”
As one of Wall Street’s oldest stock indicators, the DJIA doesn’t get shaken up often. The last member to join was Walgreens in 2018 when it replaced  General Electric, which enjoyed a 111-year tenure. Still, membership carries a certain prestige. Or does it?
“I remember when this would have mattered,” Scott Nations, founder of Nations Indexes, said on social media following the announcement.


I remember when this would have mattered. Amazon Is Joining the Dow Jones Industrial Average https://t.co/5aZkfbCCDI

So, does membership of this elite club still matter?

But now bosses are increasingly insisting that staff must make a return to their office desks.

BMO Capital Markets On IBM
Analyst Keith Bachman maintained a Market Perform rating while raising the price target from $155 to $210.
Although IBM delivered solid results for the fourth quarter, weakness in Software remains “our biggest question mark on the stock,” Bachman said in a note. The company’s full-year free cash flows were better than expected and its $12 billion guidance for fiscal 2024 was “above our and investor expectations,” he added.
“Moreover, IBM guided to the low end of its mid-single-digit growth model for FY24 which implies acceleration versus FY23,” the analyst further wrote.

The focus shifts to preliminary fourth-quarter GDP data before the market opens and the European Central Bank’s rate decision, with traders anticipating the central bank to maintain its current stance.
Cues From Wednesday's Trading:
U.S. stocks closed with a mixed performance on Wednesday, as the Dow Industrials moved further away from its all-time highs, while the S&P 500 marked its fourth consecutive all-time closing high. The varied sentiment unfolded as traders absorbed a positive quarterly report from Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and better-than-expected private sector activity data. The subdued sentiment might be attributed to concerns ahead of key economic data scheduled for release on Thursday and Friday.
Strength in the communication services sector, led by Netflix, along with gains in energy stocks, helped offset weakness in utility, real estate, material, consumer staples, and financial stocks.

This rally followed the Federal Reserve’s decision to maintain interest rates steady at 5.25%-5.5%. The Dow climbed 1.2% after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell effectively declared an end to the Fed’s rate-hiking cycle that commenced last year and hinted at the start of a rate-cutting cycle beginning in 2024.
The blue-chip index, as tracked by the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE:DIA), has channeled a rally of over 14% in the last six weeks and is on a streak of four consecutive sessions of gains.

That said, data suggests S&P 500 companies may be on track to break a fourth-quarter earnings-declining streak. 
A Mixed Bag Laced With Caution: Last week, Investors reacted to disappointing earnings reports from some high-profile companies such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG). The former spooked investors with softer-than-expected cloud revenue and the latter with its cautious guidance. 
Two of the fellow “Magnificent Seven,” namely Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) calmed investors’ nerves, either with stellar results or positive commentary regarding the near term. Chip earnings were also a mixed bag, with Texas Instruments, Inc. (NASDAQ:TXN) reporting a third-quarter miss, while Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC) cheered investors with a solid beat and positive outlook.
Energy giants Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX) reported below-consensus earnings for the quarter, and this served as a drag on the profit growth of S&P 500 companies.
Midway into the season, about 49% of the S&P 500 companies have released their earnings so far, with 78% of the companies reporting earnings beats and 62% ringing in revenue upside, data from FactSet shows.
The year-over-year blended earnings growth rate of S&P 500 companies is expected at 2.7%, potentially marking the first growth since the third quarter of 2022.
Earnings Deluge Awaits:  The tech earnings news flow continues in the unfolding week, with the likes of Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) on tap. A slew of SMID-cap companies are also scheduled to disclose their quarterly earnings scorecard.

As of midday trading in New York, all major U.S. stock indices were in negative territory, primarily due to a slump in the tech sector that had a broad impact on the market’s performance.
Despite reporting better-than-expected results, Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) faced challenges in its Cloud revenue growth, resulting in a significant 9% daily decline in its stock price — the most substantial daily drop in a year.
Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) saw a nearly 3.2% decline ahead of its quarterly earnings release scheduled after the market closes. Conversely, Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) ‘s shares surged by 3.9% following stronger-than-predicted quarterly results. 
Equity investor sentiment remained depressed as both oil prices and Treasury yields experienced increases. Market participants are anxiously awaiting the release of key GDP growth data scheduled for Thursday, which is expected to show a robust 4.3% increase. 
Cues From Thursday's Trading:
The S&P 500 fell 1.2%, falling below the 4,200 support and extending the decline since July’s peak to 9%. 
The Nasdaq 100 sharply underperformed, down 2%. Blue chips managed to contain losses, while small caps suffered a 1.4% drop.

The Week That Was: The blended year-over-year earnings of S&P 500 companies are expected to decrease by 0.4%, marking the fourth consecutive decline, according to Factset’s weekly earnings insights report. The decline in earnings is largely due to downward revisions in earnings per share (EPS) estimates for Pfizer, Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and Eli Lilly & Co. (NYSE:LLY).
Some of the notable disappointments from the past week include Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Nokia Oyj (NYSE:NOK), Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS), and Alcoa Corp. (NYSE:AA), among others. Additionally, there were negative preannouncements from companies like Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. (NYSE:HPE) and SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG).
Factset data indicates that out of the 17% of the S&P 500 companies that have reported so far, 73% have reported positive earnings per share (EPS) surprises, and 66% have reported positive revenue surprises.
The Week Ahead: With earnings from the financial sector tapering, tech companies are expected to take the spotlight this week. Investors will closely monitor earnings from communication services companies such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), along with software giant Microsoft Corporation (NYSE:MSFT) and e-commerce giant Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).

He also hinted that if the economy’s strength and inflation resurgence continue to surprise, further interest rate hikes may be on the horizon.

Bank of America noted the impact artificial intelligence can have on several sectors going forward and made the claim it could be highly disruptive.
Here’s a look at several stocks and ETFs investors should know.
Artificial Intelligence Disruption: Multiple companies could benefit from the disruption of artificial intelligence. This has led investors to look for top names that could see revenue and earnings per share gains through the technology.
“It’s not just tech companies that will benefit from AI’s newest wave. Our view is that GenAI’s transformation will likely be similar to the transformation driven by past disruptive technologies like the telephone, automobile, personal computer and internet,” Bank of America analyst Alkesh Shah said.
The analyst compiled results from a survey of analysts to predict which sectors and stocks stand out for investors.
While most disruptive technologies have taken 15 to 30 years to reach mainstream adoption, the analyst said generative artificial intelligence could reach mainstream adoption faster than many expect.
“AI-driven efficiencies and incremental revenue may appear across sectors globally as soon as the next 3-5 years, far more rapidly than past technologies and investors may anticipate, indicating that upside potential may not be fully priced in.”
The economic impact of artificial intelligence could be $15.7 trillion by 2030 according to the analyst.

An increasing share of global fund managers sees it as the most likely outcome over the next 12 months:

Market

Prices as of 4 pm EST, 7/18/23
Macro
Here are some highlights from BofA’s latest Global Fund Manager Survey:


Investors still expect global growth to weaken in the next 12 months.


But only 48% predict a recession by the end of Q1 2024.


In fact, most (68%) see a soft landing as the most likely outcome over the next year.


Sentiment, however, is still stubbornly low.


Investors expect the Fed’s first cut will come in Q2 2024.



June’s retail sales report revealed mixed signals about consumer strength.


Headline sales missed expectations, rising by 0.2% (vs. 0.5% expected) MoM to 1.5% YoY (vs. 1.6% expected).


On the other hand, spending on the core/control group–which excludes food, autos, gas, and building materials and is used to calculate GDP–jumped by 0.6%.


Overall, consumer spending softened but flashed resilience in June amid higher prices and borrowing costs.



Homebuilder confidence rose for the 7th consecutive month in July.


The NAHB Housing Market Index is at its highest since June 2022.


With record-low inventories boosting demand, why wouldn’t it be?


According to Redfin, the total number of homes for sale dropped 15% YoY in June to an all-time low (chart).


At the same time, home prices may have bottomed: June’s median sale price decline was the smallest of the past 5 months (chart) and homes are beginning to sell above their list prices.

Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) fell nearly 10% on the day as the electric car manufacturer announced further price cuts and recorded its lowest quarterly gross margin in two years. 
Loretta Mester, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, said the Fed needs to raise rates above 5% and maintain them there for a while, but also remarked that the rate-hike journey is nearing its conclusion.

All major equity indices traded lower for the day, with the S&P 500 index down 0.3%, the Nasdaq 100 down 0.1% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.2%. Small caps in the Russell 2000 index underperformed, down 0.4%.

Analyst Color: 
The market has been trading largely in-line with long-term interest rates in 2023, and rates may determine the outcome for the major indexes in the first half of the year, Justin Zacks, vice president of strategy of Moomoo Technologies Inc., told Benzinga Thursday. 
""While there have been individual earnings movers (such as Tesla) so far this season, the overall market has had little overall reaction to companies’ results,"" Zacks said.
The Fed's next meeting in May could mark an inflection point, the Moomoo strategist said. 
""If it is the last time the Fed hikes rates, the real question will be whether it will quickly reverse course or hold policy steady for a longer period, something market participants are currently split on,"" he said. 
""Technically in 2023, the S&P 500 has broadly traded in a channel between 3,800 and 4,200. With the 10-year note down over 35 basis points this year, the S&P 500 is approaching that upper bound of 4,200. A break of either side of this channel may determine the market’s trajectory in the months to come.""

Analyst Color: 
The Fed could stay on course despite the economic slowdown and raise rates at the upcoming May 2-3 meeting, according to Jeffrey Roach, the chief economist at LPL Financial.

Here's a quick rundown of the report and why analysts were pointing to a ""loaded"" second half of the year.
What Happened: IBM reported fourth-quarter revenue of $16.69 billion, which beat average analyst estimates of $16.4 billion, according to Benzinga Pro. The company said its top-line results were flat on a year-over-year basis.
IBM's fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $3.60 per share were in line with consensus estimates.
IBM guided for full-year 2023 revenue growth in the mid-single digit range and said it expected consolidated free cash flow to increase by about $1 billion this year.
Analyst Reactions: Most analysts seemed to be in agreement following IBM's quarterly results: it's still a ""show-me story,"" Morgan Stanley said.
Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring reiterated IBM with an Equal-Weight rating and a $143 price target, noting the firm remained cautious on the credit side of the business given the company's valuation.
The fourth-quarter results and first-quarter guide were largely in line with Morgan Stanley's expectations.

Analyst Color: 
Microsoft’s commentary on the earnings call worried the market, which is so intensely concerned about economic growth, LPL Financial chief global strategist Quincy Crosby  said in a note. The message from Microsoft’s management was “the economy is slowing, and their customers are more cautious about spending,” the analyst said.
“There’s still a long way to go during the reporting season, but guidance is becoming even more important than it was before last night’s Microsoft earnings call,” he added.

Tuesday, the major averages closed mixed, as traders factored in Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.’s (NYSE: GS) disappointing earnings and the bleak business activity reading for the New York region.
Stocks started the session lower but clawed back their early losses only to sink further after the New York Federal Reserve’s Empire Manufacturing Survey showed a steeper-than-expected contraction in January.
The Dow Industrials recorded a loss of over 1%, as Goldman weighed down on the 30-stock blue-chip index. The buoyancy in the tech space helped the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite close modestly higher for the session and at a fresh one-month high.
Most sectors closed in the red, led by materials, financials, communication services and healthcare stocks. The only noteworthy gains were recorded by the tech space.

Earnings will dominate macro considerations, as management teams’ offer their outlook and an investor may be well advised to stay focused on earnings, fund manager Louis Navellier said in a note.
LPL Financial Chief Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder said the earnings season may not offer much in the way of good news but the pessimism may have been overdone. Investors will likely be surprised at how well stocks hold up on the news.
“Look for earnings throughout the next year to exceed those pessimistic forecasts and—along with falling inflation and the end of Federal Reserve rate hikes—serve as positive catalysts for solid gains for stocks in 2023,” he added.

While there, Benzinga sought to recognize the innovation in accounting technology and spoke with founders, investors and other interested parties.
The following is a chat with Xero Limited (OTC: XROLF) CEO Steve Vamos and Chief Growth Officer Chris O’Neill.
The following text is edited for clarity and concision.
Q: Nice to meet you, both! Care to start off with an introduction?
Vamos: I've been in the industry since when the big new thing was mini computers, working at IBM (NYSE: IBM).
The reason I'm here today is that one of my experiences was in the birth of digital advertising and the change journey that involved.
So, all the while many experts thought digital media was never going to work, I became a CEO of a joint venture between Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and a media company to try and drive the growth of the online media industry. This happened when Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) was one of the early experimenters of digital advertising in 1997 or 1998.

O’Neill: Around 1998 I was applying to graduate school.
I was curious about California and I took a couple of months for an assignment there. Fast forward, I stayed for 25 years after I was bitten by the tech bug during the first wave of craziness in the Valley.
I was fortunate to find my to way Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) and the highest watermark for that was my experience in Canada.
About 63% of Canadian businesses didn't even have a website. And, more disturbingly, they didn't even know why they would need one. So we went on this journey, with a bunch of people, including the government, to get people online.
After that, I ran Evernote for a while, a category-creating company that catalyzed the vision that you can write in one place and it shows up everywhere else.

That’s not necessarily the right thing to do, explains Herb founder and CEO Matt Gray whose mission is to pay it forward and inspire 10 million entrepreneurs to live their dreams.
Amidst a slowing economy, Gray urged entrepreneurs to recognize their venture is a marathon and, in order to speed up, they should consider “slowing down and taking better care of themselves and those around them.”
Why’s that? Read on for Gray’s journey in building and selling businesses, perspectives and tips for success.
Find A Problem And Solve It: The Sharon, Ontario native’s foray into entrepreneurship started at 20 years old.
While managing 28 retail locations for Kraft Heinz Co (NASDAQ: KHC), on the side with three friends, Gray built Bitmaker Labs, a school for technologists.
“It was a place for software engineers to train for jobs at technology companies like Shopify Inc (NYSE: SHOP), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: META), and IBM (NYSE: IBM).”
After training nearly 3,000 technologists, and selling it to General Assembly, Gray pivoted.
This time, the problem was that there “existed no platform for consumers and brands to connect over curated and trustworthy content,” he explained on getting the word out about the treatment that saved his friends' lives from feelings of suicide and depression.
“There wasn’t an experience akin to the kind you’d expect outside of weed.”
The Google Of Weed: Over the course of nearly a decade, Gray and a small team of up to 50 grew Herb to a community of 41 million loyal fans, all raving for what is 31,000 published pieces of cannabis-focused content.
Gray practices what he preaches. For those years Herb has operated, it has only published, consistently, 12 pieces of content a day on culture, education, “and everything in between.”
Now, some may wonder how this endeavor makes money? That’s simple, Gray says: “When you’re ...","Penny Stocks,Cannabis,Entrepreneurship,Small Cap,Success Stories,Markets,Interview,General"

For example, the Rubik’s Cube. This innovative toy made by Hungarian professor, sculptor and “serious puzzler” Ernő Rubik in 1974 was meant to be a visual aid for his students to understand three-dimensional design. After being licensed by Rubik to be sold by Ideal Toy Corp, the tiny maddening cube was the bestselling puzzle game and toy of all time with an estimated 400 million units sold worldwide.
To qualify the top-10 bestselling products of all time, we broke them into categories of items we think are most used globally, then looked at the individual products in those categories that dominated the market. In some cases, we could not find exact sales figures, so the information was gathered from various sources.

As a general rule, going to college provides more opportunities than not. At the same time, the cost of higher education is increasing and some would-be university students are essentially priced out of attending.
Researchers at Georgetown University discovered that from 1980 to 2019, the cost of college increased by 169%, while the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland estimated median income in the U.S. had increased 30% from 1980 to 2018.
Aware of this, some major companies are bypassing the once-required bachelor’s degree in response to the inflated costs of higher education, opening the door to thousands of potential hires.

The S&P 500 average dividend yield is currently 1.4%, but there are a handful of quality S&P 500 stocks with dividend yields above 4%. Unfortunately, a dividend yield is only as good as the company paying it, and an extremely high dividend yield can often be a red flag that a stock has underperformed significantly.
Here are six S&P 500 dividend stocks with at least 4% yields that investors can buy and sleep easy at night, according to Bank of America.

But while the Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) chieftain’s $54.20 per share bid for Twitter (NYSE: TWTR) continues to resonate, let’s pause to consider earlier attempts at hostile takeovers by well-respected and well-financed entities and individuals that — to ransack some Musk-worthy clichés — took off like a rocket ship but eventually vanished like a wisp of blunt smoke.
Hewlett Packard’s Failed Takeover of PricewaterhouseCooper: In September 2000, HP Inc (NYSE: HPQ) sought to expand its technology advisory services by acquiring PwC’s consultancy unit for $18 billion.
But two months after making its unsolicited bid, HP abruptly walked away after failing to secure any common ground with PwC. HP Chairwoman and CEO Carly Fiorina lamented that because of “the current market environment, we are no longer confident that we can satisfy our value creation and employee retention objectives — and I am unwilling to subject the HP organization to the continuing distraction of pursuing this acquisition any further.”
Two years later, HP’s executives received a surprise call from PwC. It seemed that HP’s rival IBM (NYSE: IBM) was making a bid for PwC’s consulting unit for $3.5 billion, a considerably lower sum than HP offered, and PwC wanted to see if HP was interested in picking up from where it was previously disconnected. Juergen Rottler, vice-president of marketing of strategy and alliances at HP Services, told ComputerWeekly.com that HP was not eager to pick up where it left off.

The Japanese yen is now trading at a three-year low against the dollar. The U.S. dollar Index ($DXY) is working on a two-day rally against a basket of other currencies.
The falling yen prompted a rally in Japanese markets. The Nikkei 225 (N225:JP) rose 1.77% overnight. Japan hasn’t had the same inflationary problems as other countries, so the Bank of Japan is still pushing economic stimulus. If the yen continues to weaken, it could help the Nikkei 225 continue to gain ground.  
Equity index futures were trading higher before the bell as stocks hit the final official day of the Santa Claus rally. The S&P 500 futures (/ES) rose a quarter of a percent in premarket action. If investors follow through after the opening bell, the S&P 500 could be set to create another all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (/YM) were also up 0.27% in premarket trading and looking to create a new all-time high too.
Energy stocks could lead other sectors again on Tuesday because crude oil futures (/CL) were also trading higher on Tuesday morning rising 1.13% in premarket trading. The commodity looks to be bouncing off an important support level. Consumer staples could also be set up for a good day because some of its companies are seeing analyst upgrades. Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) was upgraded by Guggenheim from neutral to a buy. Yesterday, McDonald’s (NYSE: MCD) was upgraded too.
Investors appear to be unconcerned about rising COVID-19 cases. According to data from John Hopkins University, more than 1 million more cases were reported on Monday. One reason the numbers were higher was because of a delay in reporting from some U.S. states. The Omicron variant continues to spread but the case doesn’t seem to be as severe as the Delta variant.
In fact, cruise line Carnival (NYSE: CCL) was among several travel and leisure stocks climbing in premarket trading. Travel and leisure have been among the hardest companies hit by COVID-19 because it has hit all workers including pilots, flight attendants, baggage handlers, and more.  
The airline was able to influence a dispute between the United States government and AT&T (NYSE: T) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ) over the companies’ 5G plans and how they might affect airline safety.

The near-term sell-off, the analyst said, is a painful digestion period, along with a reaction to omicron fears.
The Street has also begun discounting a tighter Fed and a constrained valuation framework for tech stocks, he said. 
""We remain firmly bullish on tech stocks for 2022,"" Ives noted.
Here are Wedbush's top 10 tech predictions for the year 2022:
1. Apple AR/VR Glass:  Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) is expected to launch its long-awaited  AR/VR headset Apple Glasses  in the summer of 2022. This will serve as a major growth catalyst for Apple shares by way of providing scope for the further monetization of the company's installed base, the analyst said.
2. Nasdaq Year-End Target:  Wedbush's year-end 2022 target for the Nasdaq Composite Index is 19,000 thanks to the digital transformation among enterprises and consumers. The underlying growth prospects for the tech sector are 2-3 times the normalized/historical patterns, the firm said.

The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) moved back above the 20 level before the open. Tech stocks look to be laggards once again with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) all trading lower in premarket action.
However, Oracle (ORCL) appears to be falling for a different reason, The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Oracle is in talks to buy Cerner (CERN) for $30 billion. Oracle fell 4.77% in premarket trading while Cerner rallied 16.37%.
Financial stocks could also trade a little lower on Friday because the 10-year Treasury yield (TNX) has fallen below 1.4%. The 10 years fell as oil prices (/CL) dropped 1.73% before the opening.
There are a couple of executive changes of note this morning starting with General Motors (NYSE: GM). Dan Ammann the CEO of GM’s autonomous vehicle company Cruise LLC has unexpectedly left the company. Some had speculated that Ammann was being groomed to replace current GM CEO Mary Barra in the future. GM is down 2.62% in premarket trading.
Darden Restaurants (NYSE: DRI) announced better-than-expected earnings and revenue before the opening bell but lowered its future earnings guidance. It also announced that CEO Eugene Lee Jr. would retire in May of 2022. Darden was down 3.89% in premarket trading. 
Kellogg’s (NYSE: K) management team was able to resolve an ongoing labor issue with its worker’s union. The stock rallied 3.59% on Thursday as rumors of the deal emerged.
The COVID-19 Omicron variant is pushing across New York and New Jersey prompting some businesses to shut down while others are having their employees work from home. Also, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) is down 2% in premarket trading after a CDC panel recommended the Moderna (NASDAQ: MRNA) and Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) COVID-19 vaccines over the JNJ vaccine.  
On top of Omicron news and the big tech selling, this Friday is a quadruple witching day which means stock index futures, stock index options, stock options, and single stocks futures contracts expire simultaneously. As traders unwind these trades it can result in greater volatility so investors should be extra careful during the first and last trading hours of the day.
Big Tech Barrage
When the Fed sparked a late afternoon rally on Wednesday, it looked like it would usher in an early start to the Santa Claus rally. But the momentum fizzled on Thursday as investors chose to focus on value stocks instead. However, the Santa rally doesn’t technically start until after the Christmas break, so investors watching for the phenomenon still have hope.
Big-tech stocks were among the worst performers on Thursday as investors appear to be moving from growth to value stocks once again. The S&P 500 Pure Growth Index ($SP500PG) dropped 2.64%, while the S&P 500 Pure Value Index ($SP500PV) rose 0.81%. Among the big-tech growth stocks that were falling were Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), which fell 3.93%, 2.91%, 5.03%, and 6.8% respectively.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average consists of 30 stocks on a price-weighted basis.
The index has changed its holdings many times throughout history and tries to provide a balanced look at top sectors and value names. Many of the companies included in the index pay quarterly dividends.
At the time of writing, 27 of the 30 holdings pay dividends. Boeing Inc (NYSE: BA) and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) suspended dividend payouts due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM) does not pay a dividend.
The average dividend yield is 2.4% of the 30 stocks in the index.

However, there’s some uneasiness as President Joe Biden warns that Russia could invade Ukraine. According to The Wall Street Journal, Russia has had an unusual amount of troop movement near its Ukrainian border. Many believe that President Putin is posturing because he wants to push through Russia’s Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline into Europe, but Ukraine is blocking its development. European natural gas price rose about 6% overnight and U.S. natural gas futures (/NG) are trading 4.18% higher before the open.
Outside of these tensions, Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech (NASDAQ: BNTX) released information showing that they won’t need to change their vaccine for the Omicron variant and that a third dose of the vaccine offers the protection people need. Pfizer rallied 0.73% on the news before the open but BioNTech was down 0.59% in premarket trading.
Despite earnings season being over, there are a few companies still releasing their previous quarter results. Campbell Soup (NYSE: CPB) missed on revenue estimates because people are eating fewer meals at home and going back to restaurants. The miss on revenue didn’t keep the company from achieving better than expected earnings. The stock rallied about 1% in premarket action on the news.
RV maker Thor Industries (NYSE: THO) also announced earnings beating on both top and bottom lines. The company saw a 56% increase in net sales compared to a year ago, which helped the company increase its gross profit margins by 16.6%. The stock rose 3.86% in premarket trading.
Stocks saw a broad rally on Tuesday with the NYSE advancers outnumbering decliners about 5 to 1, and the Nasdaq advancers outnumbering decliners about 4 to 1. Additionally, the Russell 2000 (RUT) Index rallied 2.28%. However, the small-cap index rallied to its 200-day moving average and failed to sustain a break. If the bulls are unable to break this level, rally breadth could suffer.
The major stock indices all closed higher, led by the Nasdaq Composite (COMP:DIBS), which closed more than 3% higher on the day.

The list included 65 honorees from big companies to start-ups. The names on the list were picked by 14 editors and writers at the magazine.
“Technology is the backbone of every company today. For the first time, Fast Company is recognizing the tech breakthroughs that promise to define the future of industries, from healthcare to agriculture to artificial intelligence,” according to the magazine. 
Here are the publicly traded companies that made the list:
Mastercard: Financial services provider and credit card company Mastercard Inc (NYSE: MA) made the list thanks to its “protecting payments from quantum computing attacks.” Mastercard’s enhanced contactless payments technology was highlighted in the feature, which said the company’s added layer of protection helps keep customers safe from attacks.
IBM: Technology giant International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) may not seem like it could be the next big thing in technology given its decades in the industry. Fast Company highlights how the company designed a 2-nanometer chip that can fit over 50 billion transistors in the space of a fingernail. The introduction could lead to longer battery life for smartphones and other features.

Apple co-founder Steve Jobs took on IBM and was even featured in an iconic photo flipping off the IBM logo.
What Happened: In 1981, IBM announced it was entering the personal computer market. The move was seen as competition for Apple and led to Jobs wanting to beat the company to maintain its market.
A tear down of the first IBM computer revealed a “half-assed hackneyed attempt,” according to Jobs. The rivalry between the two companies led to Jobs trolling IBM on several occasions, as mentioned by Rally Rd Content Lead Will Stern.
Jobs famously took out a full-page ad in the Wall Street Journal in August 1981, which said “Welcome IBM. Seriously.”
“Over the next few years, Jobs refused to let up. By 1984, he’d gone full tilt – comparing the battle to a battle of almost biblical proportions,” Stern said.
Jobs said if Apple couldn’t beat IBM, nobody could.

Additionally, a hotter than expected U.S. Retail Sales report was released by the U.S. Census Bureau. Despite the increase in sales figures, a big problem that retailers are seeing is worker shortages because many workers have yet to return from the pandemic layoffs. Let’s break down all this retailer news starting with earnings.
Walmart (NYSE: WMT) announced earnings before the open. It beat on earnings and revenue estimates. The company reported a 6% increase in comparable sales excluding fuelled by its Sam’s Club division that increased 13.9%. Its eCommerce division rose 8% bring its two-year online sales growth to a staggering 87%. Walmart also increased its fiscal-year earnings outlook.
Pandemic home improvement projects have not stopped if Home Depot’s (NYSE: HD) earnings are any indication. Home Depot’s third-quarter earnings rose 9.8% on a 6.1% increase in comparative sales a year ago.
Walmart and Home Deport are both Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) components and the news has the index futures pointing higher before the open.
In other earnings news, EV maker Lucid (NASDAQ: LCID) is up more than 5% before the open. The company missed on earnings and revenue estimates but showed investors that it had a large cash position and increasing orders. Additionally, EV makers look to be big beneficiaries of President Biden’s climate change infrastructure plans.
Also, in the EV space, CEO Elon Musk continues to take profits on his company, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). According to Bloomberg, Musk has now sold a $7.8 billion worth of stock.
The U.S. retail sales report showed an increase of 1.7% which is higher than the expected 1.5%. When removing vehicle sales, the core retail sales increased 1.7%—well ahead of the 1.0% forecasted. However, the numbers are not adjusted for inflation so the better-than-expected report could be a little skewed by the rising costs of goods and services.  
Finally, the White House is also expected to announce its nomination for a Fed chairperson today. According to Barron's, the top two contenders are existing Fed Chair Jerome Powell and Fed Governor Lael Brainard.

Aside from inflation, probably the biggest focus in the economy now is the employment situation. ...","News,Earnings,Government,Regulations,Futures,Commodities,Retail Sales,Global,Economics,Federal Reserve,Markets,Tech,Media,General"

In light of this occasion, Benzinga spoke with Immutable’s chairman and CEO Jordan Fried about his efforts to improve access to blockchain equity.
Finding Crypto: Fried’s foray into digital assets and blockchain started out with building online secondary markets for video game currencies.
It wasn’t until years later while running a virtual private network (VPN) startup — Buffered VPN —  Fried found and accepted Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) for payment.
“I had become an ex-pat living in Budapest, Hungary, and the internet sucked,” he said. “There were a lot of websites that were blocked because of censorship. If the Wall Street Journal wrote an article that was very critical of the Hungarian government, the article would be blocked.”
Later, whistleblower Edward Snowden proclaimed that the U.S. government was spying on people at scale. Overnight, that development increased the VPN business 100-times over.
Fried sold the company and made it out with the bitcoin.
Building Crypto: After Buffered, Fried recalls not being at peace.
“I did everything I wanted to do in life. I saw everything. That whole time, though, I could not figure out why I was not happy,” he explained. “I learned I didn’t really need the money. The money was the fortunate byproduct of building something.”

Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) disappointed investors because of their inability to get products to consumers. This raised concerns about whether brick-and-mortar stores can meet holiday demand. Right now, it’s a cloudy picture.  
One of the most anticipated earnings announcements finally came Thursday after the close when Apple announced better-than-expected earnings but lower-than-expected revenue due to lower sales. Apple has been telegraphing that sales would be a problem due to supply chain issues and component factory shutdowns in China over energy shortages. However, the stock still traded 3.4% lower in after-hours trading.
Another highly anticipated report came from Amazon, which was down more than 4% in after-hours trading after missing on earnings and revenue. The company was hurt by product shortages, higher wage costs, higher shipping expenses, and operational investments, but it also emphasized that it’ll do “whatever it takes” to ensure a good holiday season. However, Amazon Web Services, the company’s cloud computing platform, grew by 39%.
Are the FAANG stocks going to have to change their acronym? First, Google changed to Alphabet, and now Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) is changing its name to Meta. The new name is meant to reflect the company’s goal on metaverse and not just the Facebook social media app. The metaverse includes other social media apps like Instagram, Oculus, and WhatsApp. The company is also changing its stock symbol to “MVRS” starting December 1.
Outside of technology, Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) beat on top- and bottom-line estimates but still traded 3.83% lower in after-hours trading. The company continues to feel the negative effects of the pandemic and continues to be hurt by sales in China. Continued COVID-19 outbreaks in China are slowing down consumer spending.
However, the Energy sector is in focus Friday morning as Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX) announce better-than-expected earnings and revenue. Exxon reported a 30% increase in average daily production of oil barrels from ...","News,Earnings,Futures,Commodities,Retail Sales,Global,Economics,Federal Reserve,Markets,Tech,Media,General"

Investors are sifting through another swarm of earnings, but the big headliners will come after the close today when Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) report.
Investors will be looking to see if Apple can deliver phones for Christmas in light of the chip shortage. And, Amazon’s cloud business could be in focus as the “work from home” cloud business was good for Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) but disappointing for IBM (NYSE: IBM).
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) is pointing higher ahead of the open with components Merck and Caterpillar announcing positive earnings. Drug company Merck (NYSE: MRK) reported better-than-expected revenue and earnings prompting it to rally 1.85% before the opening bell. The company also raised its full-year outlook for earnings as the success of its new cancer drug continues to help the company grow.
Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) is also higher in premarket trading after beating earnings estimates despite missing revenue. The company appears to be able to navigate higher costs because of the higher number of orders. However, the company is cautious and stressed that there could be trouble in meeting the orders. Despite the caution, Cat Financial reported 110% increase in the division’s earnings because lending remains solid.
Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA) beat earnings as well thanks to growth in broadband and recovery in its Universal Studios theme parks. The stock was up 3.6% in premarket trading.
On the negative side, e-commerce firm Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) is down 3.6% before the open in response to missing on earnings and revenue. The company reported issues with the global supply chain, but also lower e-commerce growth. This could be a sign that consumers are changing their focus from online shopping to other avenues.
Also, Royal Dutch Shell (RDS/A) is down 4% in premarket trading after the oil company missed on earnings. The company cited costs related to damages from Hurricane Ida in the U.S. as a reason for the miss. The company is also setting tougher emissions targets for itself which could add to its growing costs.
Crude oil (/CL) is falling a little as Iran rejoins the nuclear talks. Lower prices could provide some relief for transports, particularly airlines where fuel is such a large expense.

IBM is fighting to adapt and modernize its business model to a cloud-centric, subscription-based business, but value investors may be wondering if there’s any value in IBM shares at their current price.
Earnings: A price-to-earnings ratio (PE) is one of the most basic fundamental metrics for gauging a stock’s value. The lower the PE, the higher the value. For comparison, the S&P 500’s PE is currently at about 28.2, nearly double its long-term average of 15.9.

Starting with a surprise from AT&T (NYSE: T), the company is trading higher in premarket trading after beating on earnings despite missing on revenue. AT&T saw growth over the last quarter with strength in HBO, wireless subscriptions, and postpaid and prepaid phones.
Unilever (NYSE: UL) demonstrated pricing power by raising prices on its products by 4.1% in the third quarter and delivered better-than-expected revenues. The ability for a company to pass on its higher costs to consumers can be difficult, but Unilever was able to do it. However, the company warned that it expects to see higher inflation next year. Whether or not the company can continue to pass on these costs is unknown.  
Copper miner Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE: FCX) is trading 1.82% lower after reporting disappointing revenues despite beating on earnings estimates. The company has benefited from a nearly 50% increase in copper prices. 
On Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) is in talks to acquire social media company Pinterest (NYSE: PINS). PayPal’s stock price fell nearly 5% on the news. However, Pinterest rose 12.77% after being briefly halted due to the quick rally. On Thursday, PayPal will report its third-quarter earnings
After the close, more earnings announcements will come in for companies like Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC), Chipotle (NYSE: CMG), and Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE: WHR). These companies could provide additional insights as to how various parts of the economy are handling supply chain issues. Additionally, Whirlpool is seen by some investors as an insight into the housing market.
After Wednesday’s close, automaker and technology company Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) reported better-than-expected earnings, but the news didn’t really seem to surprise investors. Earlier this month, the company had already reported that it had made record deliveries in the third quarter. Tesla also reiterated its previous forward guidance to achieve 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries over the next few years.

See Also: BEST ROBERT KIYOSAKI BOOKS 
What Happened: Kiyosaki said Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has started selling stock at a much faster pace than before — largely to finance a new endeavor that he himself describes as ""the most important thing I'm doing right now.""
In 2017, Bezos said that he would sell only $1 billion of stock per year, but in 2020 he sold over $10.2 billion and in 2021 he has already sold $5.1 billion.
Kiyosaki-promoted entrepreneur, investor and hedge fund manager James Altucher expects that more about the project will be revealed at an Oct. 19 conference. This endeavor places Bezos in direct competition with Elon Musk's Starlink global internet service powered by a vast low-orbit satellite constellation. 
Altucher's analysis points out Amazon's patent grant #10556709, which describes an energy-efficient system capable of launching payloads into orbit at high speeds. A maritime that would use the principles of whip dynamics to move a cable with one or multiple aerial vehicles attached to ""create, propagate, and accelerate a whip waveform along the cable toward the payload."" This would — in principle — accelerate the payload enough to reach orbit.
Altucher believes that this technology will be used to power Bezos' ""Universal Internet,"" which is also known as ...",Trading Ideas
